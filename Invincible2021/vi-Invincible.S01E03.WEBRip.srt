1
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,291
Tôi đã từng đánh với những thứ không thể tưởng tượng được

2
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,625
khi bảo vệ thế giới này.

3
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,458
Tôi đã giao chiến với những tên bạo chúa ngoài hành tinh,

4
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,958
đánh bại những nỗi ác mộng từ cõi sâu.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,791
Mặt đối mặt với những vị thần cổ xưa...

6
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,958
nhưng cho dù đối mặt với mối nguy nào đi nữa,

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,875
Tôi biết rằng tôi không phải một mình đối mặt.

8
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,833
Darkwing.

9
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,375
Aquarus.

10
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,875
War Woman.

11
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,958
Green Ghost.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,041
Red Rush.

13
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,041
Martian Man.

14
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,708
Immortal.

15
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,875
The Guardians of the Globe.

16
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:32,458
Hôm nay, chúng ta đã mất đi những gã khổng lồ vĩ đại,

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,375
người bảo vệ,

18
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,041
anh hùng,

19
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,625
và để lại cho chúng ta hoài nghi...

20
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,625
Giờ đây ai sẽ cứu chúng ta?

21
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,458
Tôi sẽ làm điều đó,

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,708
và những người có sức mạnh khác như tôi.

23
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,708
Những anh hùng mới đáp lại lời kêu gọi này.

24
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,208
Những chiến binh mới sẵn sàng
đánh đổi mọi thứ

25
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,125
để giữ cho hành tinh này được an toàn.

26
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:58,041
Tất cả được truyền cảm hứng từ các
linh hồn vĩ đại này

27
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,625
đã đi trước chúng ta.

28
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,041
Các bạn sẽ có nhứng lúc ngờ hoặc,

29
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,125
về nỗi sợ,

30
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,958
về sự không chắc chắn,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
nhưng trong những khoảnh khắc ấy,
hãy có niềm tin...

32
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,250
và nhìn lên trời cao.

33
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,184
Chúng ta phải để mọi người trải qua

34
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,250
nỗi đau này nữa sao?

35
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,375
Bữa vừa rồi chỉ là trình diễn,

36
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,458
nhưng công chúng không thể được biết

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,833
nơi mà xác của những người này được chôn.

38
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,541
Những kẻ đào mồ.

39
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,958
Lạy chúa.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,125
Tôi chưa bao giờ là một thành viên chính thức của
Guardian of the Globe,

41
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,208
nhưng chính Guardians đã chào đón tôi

42
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,458
khi tôi lần đầu bước chân lên hành tinh này.

43
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,875
Họ là các đàn anh.

44
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,791
Là chiến hữu của tôi.

45
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,708
Là bạn bè tôi.

46
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,083
Họ biết được sự thật của cuộc sống tàn nhẫn này.

47
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,416
Martian Man bị trục xuất khỏi hành tinh mình.

48
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,625
War Woman đến từ một thời đại khác.

49
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,333
Darkwing...

50
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:03,458
Chà Darkwing, anh ấy là một người đơn độc.

51
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,583
Đó là một sự hiếm hoi, may mắn với chúng ta

52
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:10,541
đã gặp được những người có cùng chung chí hướng,

53
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,541
hiếm hoi hơn nữa khi người ta chấp nhận nó.

54
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,625
Tôi mong rằng họ sẽ yên nghỉ,

55
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,791
và hơn hết họ sẽ được yên nghỉ cùng nhau.

56
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,500
Bỏ tay ra khỏi tôi!

57
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,958
Olga, làm ơn, bình tĩnh lại.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,791
Các người còn không để tôi nhìn mặt anh ấy.

59
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,458
Josef cuối cùng đã yên nghỉ,

60
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,708
và tôi vẫn không thể nhìn anh ấy!

61
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:37,875
Mẹ nên...

62
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:38,958
Vâng.

63
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,708
Cậu ổn chứ?

64
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,791
Mình ư? Tớ... tớ không biết nữa.

65
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,250
Nó cứ như một giấc mơ.

66
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,351
Đó có thể đã là mẹ mình,

67
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,333
đang đặt bố mình xuống trong những hố này,

68
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,625
hoặc là mình.

69
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,226
Nếu chuyện này có thể xảy ra với Guardians of the Globe,

70
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,490
điều đó có nghĩa không ai trong chúng ta là...

71
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,708
Đây là đám tang riêng, Darkblood.

72
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,708
Chưa bao giờ được mời.

73
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,500
Vẫn có mặt.

74
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,791
Anh muốn gì?

75
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,250
Giống như anh.

76
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,333
Tìm các manh mối.
Tóm tên sát nhân.

77
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,875
Đem ra công lý.

78
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,291
Và cho bản thân mình thêm vài năm
không phải quay lại địa ngục.

79
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,750
Đừng giả vờ anh làm điều này vì anh thực sự quan tâm.

80
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,916
Anh chỉ không muốn về nhà mà thôi.

81
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,000
Có lẽ một ngày nào đó, anh sẽ biết lý do tại sao.

82
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:39,083
Tôi đã kể hết cho Cecil tất cả những gì tôi biết.

83
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,000
Không thấy gì.
Không nghe gì.

84
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,791
Bị tập kích ở trong bóng tối.

85
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,458
Để mặc chết.

86
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,625
Anh đang nói bóng gió gì hả?

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,916
Không có ý xúc phạm.

88
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:54,291
Cuộc hội thoại có ẩn ý như con người tôi không làm được.

89
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,416
Nếu anh nhớ ra chuyện gì...

90
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,625
Tôi sẽ gọi cho anh.

91
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,625
Josef...

92
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,875
Để tôi đưa cô ra xe nàom Olga.

93
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,166
Robot!

94
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,916
Đối với cả mớ mã lập trình như anh,

95
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,666
có thể vận hành cả đội siêu anh hùng cục xúc nữa.

96
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,791
Anh thực sự đã cứu vớt chúng ta với lũ Flaxans kia.

97
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,791
Cám ơn, Cecil.

98
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,541
Điều nói ra từ miệng ông thật có ý nghĩa.

99
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,416
Tôi biết trước giờ
cậu luôn làm việc độc lập,

100
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,666
nhưng tôi muốn cậu làm cho GDA,

101
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,750
và xây dựng cho tôi một Guardians of the Globe mới.

102
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,250
Giờ, giao cho cậu tuyển chọn thành viên,

103
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,541
cậu sẽ là đội trưởng.

104
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:27,208
Người duy nhất mà cậu phải tuân lệnh là tôi

105
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,416
Xin thứ lỗi,

106
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,059
nhưng Omni-Man chẳng phải là
một lựa chọn tốt hơn hay sao?

107
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,083
Đúng.

108
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,708
Ngoại trừ việc đó sẽ không bao giờ xảy ra.

109
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,708
Tôi đã cố cả thập kỉ

110
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,166
để khiến anh ta là một thành viên chính thức của Guardians.

111
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,333
Anh ta có giúp, phải,

112
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,916
nhưng anh ta không bao giờ nhận lênh,

113
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,041
ít nhất là không phải từ tôi.

114
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,875
Vậy thì tôi không có lời nào để nói...

115
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,083
Đơn giản thôi.

116
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,083
Nói là cậu sẽ làm.

117
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,166
Anh đang thấy thèm pizza.

118
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,333
Anh có thể đến Naples và quay lại

119
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,416
trước khi phô mai hết ngừng tan ra.

120
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,375
Anh yêu,

121
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,958
tối nay nãy để cho shipper giao bánh đi.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,791
Tất nhiên rồi.

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,708
Tôi đã giao chiến với những tên bạo chúa ngoài hành tinh,

124
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,708
đánh bại những nỗi ác mộng từ cõi sâu.

125
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,250
mặt đối mặt với...

126
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,625
Các bạn sẽ có nhứng lúc ngờ hoặc...

127
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,916
Để lại cho chúng ta hoài nghi...

128
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,250
- Mark...
- Giờ đây ai sẽ cứu rỗi chúng ta?

129
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,351
Sao con không gọi William?

130
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,458
Và làm gì?

131
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,041
Đi chơi?
Đi mua truyện tranh?

132
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:21,916
Sau chuyện này ư?

133
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:22,750
Này...

134
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,875
Giọng điệu gì thế. 

135
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:24,791
Không sao cả.

136
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,916
Không.

137
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,708
Chuyện này mới, ta biết điều đó,

138
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,250
nhưng con cần tách chúng ra.

139
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,500
Những gì xảy ra ngoài kia, những sai lầm,

140
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,666
kể cả những chiến thắng,

141
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,875
con không thể cứ mang về nhà.

142
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,375
Được chứ?

143
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,833
Con lên phòng mình được chứ?

144
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,166
Được chứ.

145
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,166
Này, chúng ta có thể luyện tập vào ngày mai, được chứ?

146
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,416
Chỉ 2 bố con.

147
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Gì cơ?

148
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,916
Chúng ta chỉ vừa từ đám tang của bạn anh về.

149
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:53,791
Đồng nghiệp của anh.

150
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,708
Và anh nói về pizza,

151
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,708
và nói với Mark không được bày tỏ cảm xúc mình?

152
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,750
Đây là cuộc sống thực tại.

153
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,166
Mark cần phải học điều đó.

154
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,500
Nếu Mark và em là người chôn anh ngày hôm nay thì sao hả? 

155
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,875
Anh không dễ bị giết vậy đâu.

156
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,083
Phải, em cá rằng Red Rush cũng đã bảo Olga như vậy.

157
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,000
Này, anh ta có thể chạy nhanh, được chứ?

158
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,625
Nó không phải là một trong những
sức mạnh tối cao.

159
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,041
Anh xin lỗi.

160
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,833
Anh không có ý đó,

161
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,750
nhưng Mark và anh có thể được làm nhiều điều ở ngoài kia

162
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,416
hơn là chìm đắm ở đây.

163
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,083
Nhớ rằng

164
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,333
Mark là một cậu bé 17 tuổi.

165
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,416
Tụi trẻ dễ yếu đuối hơn anh nghĩ,

166
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,416
và em không muốn một gia đình không hạnh phúc...

167
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,875
Xin chào?

168
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,125
Chào, mình là... mình là Mark.

169
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,333
Grays-Grayson.

170
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,791
Mark Grayson.

171
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,583
Ai cơ?

172
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,375
Mark?

173
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,000
Chung trường?

174
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,875
Mình biết.

175
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,875
Tớ chỉ đùa với cậu thôi.

176
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,791
Ôi chúa ơi, cậu tưởng tớ nói thiệt hử.

177
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,583
Ồ, không, không, tớ...

178
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,666
Tớ biết mà.

179
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,541
Tớ còn đang thắc mắc cậu có gọi không chứ.

180
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,666
Ý cậu là "khi nào mình sẽ gọi"?

181
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,625
Nah, Tớ có thể kể một vài lý do cho việc "cậu có gọi hay không".

182
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,833
Tớ khá mạnh mẽ.

183
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,125
Cậu đã có bạn gái.

184
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,476
Cậu thì tầm thường và không thích những cô nàng

185
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,351
đá những tên khốn vào chỗ hiểm khi họ dọa...

186
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,166
Uh...

187
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,750
Cậu sợ tôi đúng không?

188
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:48,750
Không phải!

189
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,666
Mình nghĩ cậu thật tuyệt vời.

190
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,142
Đó là lý do mình gọi, để nói cho cậu điều đó.

191
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,000
Ý mình...

192
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,750
đó không phải là lý do mình gọi.

193
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,208
Không không, nó không đúng.

194
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,791
Chài ai...

195
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,708
Xin lỗi.

196
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,041
Đây là một ngày kì quặc.

197
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,833
Có vẻ như thế thật.

198
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,208
Cậu có muốn nói lại không?

199
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,125
Chào, Mark Grayson đẹp chai?

200
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,166
Có chuyện gì thế?

201
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,791
Tớ đang nghĩ là, kỳ thi cuối kỳ sắp đến rồi,

202
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,958
và chúng ta đều cùng lớp Global Issues của Cô Walker.

203
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,583
Chúng ta có thể cùng nhau ôn lại từ đầu được không?

204
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,000
Một cuộc hẹn học nhóm ư?

205
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,833
Làm tốt lắm.

206
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,333
An toàn và có trách nhiệm.

207
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,375
Không có cảm giác áp lực,

208
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,476
nhưng có thể để cho mọi việc tiến triển

209
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,666
đến một mối quan hệ mới.

210
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,375
Mượt đấy.

211
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,708
Uh...

212
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,125
Okê con dê.

213
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,416
Thời gian địa điểm?

214
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,708
Có ai ở nhà không?

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,541
Eve?

216
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,541
Mình tưởng cậu còn ở đám tang chứ.

217
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,875
Tôi đã đến dự.

218
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:00,833
Tôi đã nghĩ cậu nên ở đó,

219
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,333
nhưng nó khá tẻ nhạt.

220
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,208
Bạn gái Red Rush bị suy sụp, và...

221
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,416
Cậu làm sao thế?

222
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,500
Ắt xì.

223
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,750
Hmm.

224
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,958
Chuyện gì đang xảy ra thế?

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,291
Rex có ở đây không?

226
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,500
Rex?

227
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,250
Eve, chờ đã...

228
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,250
Đkm thằng đểu cáng!

229
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,458
Cục cưng, chờ đã!
Bình tĩnh!

230
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,851
Mình biết ngay là có lý do
anh bỏ đám tang mà.

231
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,041
- Nghe anh giải thích!
- Đừng hòng...

232
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,708
Ôi chúa ơi!

233
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,500
Cô đùa tôi hả Kate?

234
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,416
Mình không thể tin được chuyện này.

235
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,250
Eve...

236
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,208
Mình đúng là tên ngôk'

237
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,250
Rex nói là giờ cậu đang cặp với Invincible.

238
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,750
Nói rằng 2 người đã nói về chuyện đó.

239
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,833
Cái gì cơ?

240
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,958
Thôi đừng nhìn tao với ánh mắt đó.

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,791
Đó là sự thật.

242
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,958
Cô đang mong chờ gì hả?

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,291
Nó không đúng,

244
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,250
và cho dù tôi đang mong chờ gì đi nữa,
tôi nghĩ tôi đã nhầm,

245
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,250
về cả 2 người.

246
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,666
Chờ đã!

247
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,500
Chuyện này ư?

248
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,500
Chuyện này không có nghĩa lý chi hết!

249
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,083
Bọn họ còn không phải là Kate thật!

250
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,500
Tụi này đều là Kate thật.

251
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,875
Được rồi, tôi...

252
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,083
Tôi không có...

253
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,291
Đó không phải là ý...

254
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,166
Cô hiểu ý tôi mà, đúng không?

255
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,625
Is that Demi-God?

256
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,125
Oh, Shrapnel!

257
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,583
And Burly,
Pangea, Bug-Eye...

258
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,625
It's the crowning achievement
of any crusader's career

259
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,916
to be selected for
the New Guardians of the Globe,

260
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,125
which makes me wonder again
why you won't try out.

261
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,041
I know.

262
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,458
I talked it over
with my dad.

263
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,083
He wants to train me himself.

264
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,458
Plus, my mom would kill me
if I miss any more school.

265
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,125
Then why are you here?

266
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,083
Are you kidding?

267
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,791
Like I'd miss this?

268
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,791
Oh, my god,
there's Fight Force.

269
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,666
Why'd they even come here?

270
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,666
Despite your name,

271
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,166
I believe you underestimate
yourself, Invincible.

272
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,250
I'll still be around, helping.

273
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,916
When does this all get started?

274
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,791

Dupli-Kate.

328
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,416
Monster Girl.

329
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,458
Aw, look at her,
she's adorable!

330
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,125
But isn't there, like,
an age requirement

331
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:57,958
for this ride?

332
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,875
Am I wrong?

333
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,291
'Cause this seems weird, right?

334
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,916
Rex...

335
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,416
I dunno, you're here.

336
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,625
Isn't there a dick size
requirement?

337
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,458
I'm sorry?

338
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,458
For what, your tiny dick?

339
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
I mean, the way you've been
strutting around here,

340
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,833
you must be compensating
for something.

341
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,583
Somebody ought to teach you

342
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,125
some mother-fucking...

343
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,083
What the fuck?

344
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,000
Oof!

345
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,000
Guess you missed my try-out.

346
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,375
Still think I'm adorable?

347
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,125
You little bitch.

348
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,000
Aw...

349
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,875
Now, that's adorable.

350
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:59,791
I'm gonna blast that smile
off your stupid, green face.

351
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,000
Please, stop,
this is hardly constructive.

352
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,041
Ha!

353
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,291
Uh... is this okay?

354
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,125
He asked for it.

355
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,916
Okay, enough.

356
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,416
Get lost, boy scout.

357
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,250
I said, enough!

358
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,333
Invincible hit
that little girl!

359
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,166
Oh... shit.

360
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,375
Uh, look, I'm so sorry.

361
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,041
Nah, my bad.

362
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,916
The kid thing
sets me off every time,

363
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,750
and then it's like, "Rah!"

364
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,000
Beast mode.

365
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,083
Sorry about the dick joke.

366
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,625
I'm sure your junk
is awesome.

367
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,125
It's fine.

368
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,458
I'm good.
You're good.

369
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,541
You can... punch hard.

370
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,791
Didn't need your help, asshole.

371
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,625
Aw, Christ...

372
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,333
As I was saying,

373
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,767
welcome to
the Guardians of the Globe,

374
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,750
Monster Girl...

375
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,750
I'm gonna shit blood.

376
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,500
...along with Rex Splode,

377
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,583
once he's recovered...

378
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,750
and our final member,

379
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,125
Atom Eve.

380
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,166
Thank you all for coming today.

381
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,791
We'll be making
a public announcement shortly.

382
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,833
Robot.

383
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,458
No need to thank me.

384
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
I obviously needed
to remain impartial,

385
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,750
but I'm still delighted

386
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,083
so many members of the Teen Team
made the cut.

387
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,250
I can't be on the same team
as Rex and Kate.

388
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,541
What? Why?

389
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,541
Hey, wait!

390
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,875
Rex, what did you do?

391
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,125
Thanks for the help, Robot.

392
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,625
Can't wait to be on your team.

393
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,916
Hey...

394
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,375
what's going on?

395
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,750
Rex cheated on me...

396
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,750
What?

397
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,125
...with Dupli-Kate,
all three of her.

398
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,708
Whoa.

399
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,916
Whoa...

400
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,416
I walked in on them.

401
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,500
Rex told her you and me
were a thing? Ugh.

402
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,666
Huh, what?

403
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,000
That's... crazy.

404
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,976
I didn't want to say it
while you were dating the guy,

405
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,833
but what an asshole.

406
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,625
He wasn't always,

407
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,666
but... yeah.

408
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,833
Well, that sucks.

409
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,750
I'm sorry.

410
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,583
Thanks.

411
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,250
As soon as the forensic
investigation has concluded,

412
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,500
we'll be moving into
the Guardians' headquarters.

413
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,250
Until then,
we'll be training here.

414
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,208
Breakfast is at 6:00 a.m.,

415
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,583
then close-in combat exercises
until lunch.

416
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,833
Where is Kate Prime?

417
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:40,833
Had a thing.

418
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,166
I can fill her in.

419
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,583
Okay, just to make it clear,

420
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,500
there is no universe

421
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,583
in which I wake up at 6:00 a.m.

422
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,916
and the world isn't on fire.

423
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,666
Come on, Robot.

424
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,458
We don't need
this boot camp bullshit.

425
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,625
It's us.

426
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,875
We're not on the Teen Team
any longer, Rex.

427
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:58,958
Exactly.

428
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,517
I'm sure you've had
a lot of experience

429
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,833
wrangling teenagers,

430
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,875
but I was with
the Guardians from day one.

431
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,583
Wow, thanks, Dad.

432
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,059
Maybe if you didn't
lose your powers,

433
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,684
you might've been there
to help the Guardians

434
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,375
on their last day.

435
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,625
I don't know you yet,

436
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,625
so I'm going to assume
that was a joke,

437
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,958
and I don't need
to beat your ass

438
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,875
until all you wanna do
is call me Dad again.

439
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,541
I don't know you either,

440
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,500
but we need a leader
we can look in the eye.

441
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,875
Not a bunch of ones and zeros.

442
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:27,791
No offense.

443
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,958
That's actually super offensive,

444
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,875
so wait, you think
you should be in charge?

445
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,583
I am the most experienced.

446
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,958
Yeah, at losing your powers.

447
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,458
Didn't I crack
that joke already?

448
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,125
Why are we even
putting up with this guy?

449
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,666
He wears a suit!

450
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,666
It takes batteries.

451
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,458
Let's just get Eve
back in here.

452
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,166
I'm new
to this whole team thing,

453
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,125
but I thought
it involved teamwork.

454
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,916
As did I.

455
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,250
Call me when
you figure it out.

456
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,666
I'll be in the gym.

457
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,708
Me too.

458
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,166
I'll go supervise.

459
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,291
No, you won't!

460
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,458
I can do
whatever I like.

461
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,250
Good first day, Robot.

462
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,333
I can't do
three combat exercises a day.

463
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,125
I'm on a rather tight timetable
to get this team operational.

464
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,416
Whenever I transform,
I get younger.

465
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,333
It's part of the curse
that gives me my powers.

466
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:25,083
I don't look it,
but I'm 24 years old.

467
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,958
I used to go by Monster Woman,

468
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,750
but it got too hard
to explain, so...

469
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,375
if you don't want to start
changing my diapers,

470
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,166
three exercises a day
are too much for me.

471
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,416
I didn't...

472
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,666
Of course, my apologies.

473
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,416
It must be difficult.

474
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,375
Try having a normal relationship
looking like this.

475
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,500
The guys who are interested

476
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,083
are either
going through puberty,

477
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,416
or popping up
on sex offender registries.

478
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,000
I understand what it's like

479
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,666
for the world to look at you
and see one thing,

480
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,166
never knowing the truth
of what's inside.

481
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,416
How can you understand?

482
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,875
You're a robot.

483
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,916
Pathetic.

484
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,208
This has gotta go.

485
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,666
Hide this.

486
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,541
Toss this.

487
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,708
What? Stop.

488
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,750
Hey, being a geek
is cool now, okay?

489
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,875
So, maybe Amber
likes comics, too.

490
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,041
You thought of that?

491
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,083
Ya dick.

492
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,458
I'm not talking about
the comics,

493
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,851
I'm talking about
the dirty clothes,

494
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,833
the dishes,

495
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,000
the tissues.

496
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,458
Uh...

497
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,166
Better.

498
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,833
Okay, I brought you
some homework.

499
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,041
A little Naomi Klein.

500
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,166
A touch of Margaret Atwood.

501
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,500
Some Ta-Nehisi Coates.

502
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,333
I haven't read any of those.

503
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,083
But she has,

504
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,166
so get started.

505
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,625
It'll show Amber
you're interested in her.

506
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,375
She's also into spicy foods,
stand-up comedy,

507
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,916
and fourth-wave feminism.

508
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,416
What?
I read her file.

509
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,625
I asked around at school.

510
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,500
It's just a study date,
not a first date.

511
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,541
Mark, every date
should feel like a first date.

512
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,458
Mark!
Your friend is here!

513
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,833
Go! Out the back way.

514
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,101
You can thank me later
when you call me,

515
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,333
and tell me exactly
how it all went.

516
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,291
Hi, Mrs. Grayson.
I'm Amber.

517
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,833
Um, William said
I should read it

518
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,708
to show you
that I'm interested-

519
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,083
interesting-

520
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,875
and I will,

521
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:37,541
but this is more me.

522
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,875
An honest man.

523
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,291
I like that.

524
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,541
So...

525
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,208
you're into comics.

526
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,625
Is it that obvious?

527
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,375
What's your favorite?

528
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,208
Oh, man, I can't pick
a favorite,

529
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,666
but...

530
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,958
Ooh, this one is about a guy
who's an underwater welder,

531
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,500
and starts seeing ghosts
on the bottom of the ocean,

532
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,166
and this one is about
a Jack Russell terrier

533
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,291
who's a master
of the metaphysical arts.

534
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,541
Seance Dog?

535
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,708
Cool.

536
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,208
You mind if I borrow it?

537
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,208
I mean, just to show you
that I'm interested.

538
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,416
Yeah.

539
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,541
Absolutely.

540
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,000
Okay...

541
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,833
don't know who that is.

542
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,934
Um, I figured we should start
with global issues, and then...

543
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,458
Sorry.

544
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,916
Must be a robo-call.

545
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,791
Ha, this should do it.

546
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,083
So Ms. Walker says
we should focus on the...

547
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,250
I'm gonna run
and use your bathroom

548
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,250
while you deal with that.

549
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,416
Yeah, uh, down the hall
on the left.

550
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,916
Whoa!

551
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,583
Christ almighty.

552
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,083
I didn't think
she would ever leave.

553
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,000
Hey!

554
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:54,833
Oh, what are you...

555
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,375
How did you know Amber...

556
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,125
Are you spying on me?

557
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,666
You wanna be
a super hero, right?

558
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,208
Fame, glory, get the pretty gal?

559
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,291
I mean, that's sexist, but okay.

560
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,666
Well, then, the whole concept
of personal privacy

561
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,083
or me time?

562
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,375
That's out the window.

563
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:14,375
When the world needs you,
you answer your goddamn phone!

564
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,208
Don't worry,
she hasn't flushed yet.

565
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,958
I don't even work for you!

566
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,208
And you never will,

567
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,125
not unless you show
a little respect,

568
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,958
and decide if you want to be
a superhero or not.

569
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,041
Right now?

570
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,375
Yes, Mark, right now.

571
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,708
Okay, yes.

572
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,791
I want to help.

573
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:31,958
What's the problem?

574
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,541
Rogue supervillain.

575
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,458
Public in danger.

576
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,416
Eve's already en route.

577
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,958
Here, so we can talk on the go.

578
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,625
Eve's gonna be there?

579
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,666
Oh, did that just
sweeten the deal?

580
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,125
What? No.

581
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,208
I mean, um...

582
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,375
Where?

583
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,333
Where is this... at?

584
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,666
Mount Rushmore.

585
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,041
Okay.

586
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,625
What state is that again?

587
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,958
What do they teach you kids
in school these days?

588
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,000
Who were you talking to?

589
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,291
Oh, um...

590
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,791
Yeah, the thing with the, uh,
the phone, it's, um...

591
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,333
It was a friend of my dad's,

592
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,458
and, uh...
I forgot I'd promised

593
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,416
I'd help him
with this thing, um...

594
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,916
Now?

595
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,625
How's it going in here?

596
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,708
I brought snacks.

597
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,083
South Dakota.

598
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,916
We know where
Mount Rushmore is, Cecil.

599
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,309
I wouldn't be
asking for your help,

600
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,291
but Omni-Man's dealing with
a kaiju ten time zones away,

601
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,809
and the new Guardians
are a shit show,

602
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,458
so here we are.

603
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,875
Target is Doc Seismic.

604
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,791
He has a Ph.D. in seismology,

605
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,791
so the doc thing,
that's legit.

606
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,166
Problem is, he made himself
a pair of earthquake gloves.

607
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,500
What's he want?

608
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,875
Even he doesn't seem to know.

609
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,458
Working theory
says brain damage

610
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,083
from a side effect
of those gloves.

611
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,750
He basically gets a concussion
every time he uses them.

612
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,583
So your basic
mad scientist deal.

613
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:52,625
Have fun, kids,

614
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,875
and try to remember,

615
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,958
that's a national treasure
down there.

616
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:13,375
You've come to pray
at this obscene monument?

617
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:15,708
They were oppressors!

618
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,875
Racists!

619
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,458
Slave owners!

620
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,083
I give you a new god
worthy of worship!

621
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:25,166
Bow before Doc Seismic!

622
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,208
Rah!

623
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,041
Hah!

624
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,916
Run! This way!

625
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,083
Hurry! Hurry!

626
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,000
The great emancipator?

627
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,541
He'll emancipate you...

628
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,375
from your lives!

629
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:54,541
Wow, man,

630
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,333
I'm still working
on my one-liners,

631
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:59,166
but that one is really bad.

632
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:06,583
Ha ha!

633
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:09,625
That's how you get ahead
in life.

634
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,458
See, it's not quite there,
it's not there.

635
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,625
No argument from me.

636
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:15,250
Now die!

637
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,250
Ah, thanks.

638
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,541
Anytime.

639
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:21,833
We need to take out
his gloves.

640
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,083
Those aren't gloves.

641
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,333
Gloves have fingers.

642
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,541
They're more, uh...

643
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,041
earthquake bracelets?

644
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,458
Ha! You're wearing
earthquake bracelets!

645
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,875
H'yah!

646
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:37,833
Y'ah!

647
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,166
Y'ah!

648
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,875
You should be on my side!

649
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:55,375
We could tear down
the old power structure,

650
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:57,208
build a new order!

651
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,750
I mean, look at the costume
they've got you in.

652
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:02,583
Talk about pandering
to gender roles.

653
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:04,708
I designed my own costume,

654
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,125
and I thought your doctorate
was in seismology?

655
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,958
Undergrad in sociology
and women's studies.

656
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,017
I had a minor
in African Dance,

657
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,500
but enough politics!

658
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:14,750
H'wah!

659
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:20,666
Oh...

660
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:27,250
- Whoa!
- Oh!

661
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,875
Mark!

662
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,250
Shit!

663
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,625
Bah!

664
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,958
Oof! Oh...

665
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:35,375
Thank you.

666
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:36,500
Don't mention it.

667
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,250
Eve! Eve!

668
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,250
Eve!

669
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,750
Invincible!

670
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:51,833
I got you.

671
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:52,708
He's slipping.

672
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,291
Ah, God dammit.

673
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,458
I should have spent more time
working on the jet pack!

674
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:03,583
H'ah!

675
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,791
Ugh!

676
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,416
Look out!

677
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,083
Wow, that guy is toast.

678
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,166
Oh, I see,

679
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,583
so, like, none of these
sound good, huh?

680
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,208
Oh, crap, I gotta go!

681
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,458
I-I'll talk to you later, Eve!

682
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,958
Thanks!

683
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:36,708
You're welcome.

684
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,625
Whoa, slow down.
What's up?

685
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:45,833
Cecil asked me to save
Mount Rushmore,

686
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,142
but I left Amber waiting
in the room so I gotta...

687
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,666
You left a girl in your room

688
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,625
while you flew off
to deal with a crisis?

689
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:51,958
Mm-hmm.

690
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,833
Good.

691
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,625
I mean, not good for her,
but good.

692
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:57,750
That's the tricky part
of the job,

693
00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:02,041
balancing what you wanna do,
with what you need to do.

694
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,625
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

695
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:07,125
Remember, you're not just
a superhero, Mark.

696
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:10,291
You're a Viltrumite.

697
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:16,166
We have... responsibilities
that normal humans don't.

698
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:17,708
Right.

699
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,833
Yeah, thanks.

700
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:20,916
Hey, one last piece
of fatherly advice, okay?

701
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,583
You might wanna change.

702
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,416
Oh, crap.

703
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,208
Dad, you got a little...

704
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,500
here.

705
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:40,125
I am so sorry.

706
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:42,083
I've been sitting here
for an hour.

707
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,375
I know.

708
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:45,333
Uh... Oh, that's a good one.

709
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,208
What'd you-
what'd you think?

710
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,291
Why did you even agree
to hang out

711
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,500
if you weren't gonna hang out?

712
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,333
I do want to hang out.

713
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:54,916
I just didn't think that...

714
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:57,416
Could've fooled me.

715
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:00,333
I don't even know why I came.

716
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,583
Okay, then, why did you come?

717
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,166
You didn't even know I existed
until I stood up to Todd.

718
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,333
For the record,

719
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,083
Todd kicked your ass.

720
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:11,166
For the record,

721
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:13,875
that's absolutely true.

722
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,333
I've had guys throw punches
for me before,

723
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,166
but you're the first one
who stood there and took 'em.

724
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:20,333
Twice.

725
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:24,208
I wanted to know the kind of guy
that would do that.

726
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,500
An idiot?

727
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,625
Maybe.

728
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,208
Maybe not.

729
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,500
So, what now, hmm?

730
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:31,916
I finished
all the review questions

731
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:35,125
while you were off
saving the world or whatever.

732
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,541
It's big, sir.

733
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,000
Really big.

734
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,750
First time I've seen Omni-Man
on the ropes like that.

735
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:49,166
Also, it might not be dead.

736
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,125
Huh.

737
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,333
Put it on ice.

738
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,434
You never know
when something like that

739
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,916
might come in handy.

740
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:55,000
Yes, sir.

741
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,125
Oh, good God!

742
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,708
Calamari for dinner?

743
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,250
Get that off my counter!

744
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,916
Aw, you sure?

745
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:10,250
It's considered a delicacy
in some places,

746
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:12,375
and an aphrodisiac.

747
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:14,208
Like you need it.

748
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,541
Did you call Cecil?

749
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,541
About putting
some protection on the house.

750
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:19,875
I was kinda busy.

751
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:20,875
Nolan...

752
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:22,458
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

753
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,541
Thank you.

754
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:24,958
Hey, don't forget

755
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,541
I just took down
a freakin' kaiju

756
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,083
and saved the world.

757
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,125
Your husband's a badass.

758
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:33,291
Yeah, well, you're not
the only badass in this family.

759
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:37,250
I sold a house today
that had a double homicide.

760
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,166
I told them lightning
never strikes twice.

761
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,666

773

but that wasn't
an apology, Rex.

779
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,250
You're right.

780
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,583
I'm sorry.

781
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,333
Look, give me a do-over,

782
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:48,541
just this one time.

783
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:49,583

Chow time.

790
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,583
You know the drill.

791
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:57,875
Ah, Thursday.

792
00:34:57,916 --> 00:34:59,750
Chicken pot pie.

793
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:00,951
Everybody's favorite.

794
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:03,875

797
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,250
Shit.

798
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:33,166
Ah!

799
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,833
Ah, sorry, Pete.

800
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:57,708
Hmm...

801
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,833
Damn.

802
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,416

00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,208
Mm...

804
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,250
How?

805
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,750
Obvious.

806
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,416

807
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:21,250

815
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:45,500

Multi-phased fusion generator

00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:22,958
What now?

845
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,125
I'm surprised
you don't see it,

846
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,541
you being the original
and all.

but I can always
make another one.

849
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,875
So, give me an update.

850
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:12,125
You get my team ready
for the deep end yet?

851
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,291
We still have work to do,

852
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,541
but I feel confident
in the progress

853
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,583
we've made today.

854
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,375
My apologies.

855
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:49,375
Didn't mean to scare.

856
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:51,041
What are you doing in my house?

857
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:54,125
Seeking... information.

858
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:55,750
Clues.

859
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,125
Answers.

860
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:58,541
Answers to what?

861
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:01,166
That night, the massacre.

862
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,625
Still not clear to me.

863
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:05,458
I don't know
what you're talking about.

864
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,625
You need to leave now.

865
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,000
Seven dead.

866
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:09,208
One alive.

867
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,041
Your husband.

868
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:14,458
Was hoping you could
make that piece fit.

869
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,291
Well, you'll have to ask him.

870
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:17,125
Did.

871
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,875
Answers were...

872
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,375
unsatisfactory.

873
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:22,875
Why do you care?

874
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:24,875
Escaped from hell.

875
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:28,416
Seek justice for others
to save own soul.

876
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,291
Husband told you nothing?

877
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,916
Not a whisper
to soothe your fears?

878
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,166
No.

879
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:35,083
He didn't say anything.

880
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,541
Hmm...

881
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:39,500
You have a lovely home.

882
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,166
Debbie?

883
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,333
You all right?

884
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:44,666
I thought I heard something.

885
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:48,916
I'm fine.

886
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,125
I was just coming to bed.
