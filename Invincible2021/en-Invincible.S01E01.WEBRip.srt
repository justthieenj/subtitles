1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,541
Coffee?

2
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:20,833
For sure.

3
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,125
Thanks, man.

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,458
You ready for next week?

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,583
What's next week?

6
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,458
Superhuman evasion training.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,166
We have to get recertified.

8
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,875
Look, I...
I get the need,

9
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,291
but it's the worst.

10
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,458
When I was on the force,

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,059
you had to do hand-to-hand
training all the time.

12
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,267
The guy comes at you
with a knife,

13
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,416
you gotta be ready,

14
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,166
but, uh, this is...
th-this is something else.

15
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,083
I'm supposed to learn
to tuck and roll

16
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,291
away from a guy

17
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,791
who can shoot lasers
from his eyes,

18
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,958
or control minds,

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,250
or kick a goddamn schoolbus
to the moon?

20
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,291
It's the job.

21
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,291
You're awful calm
about it.

22
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,916
Hell, last time
you sprained your back.

23
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:56,833
You...

24
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:57,875
Aw, shit, wait,

25
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,434
you're not even
gonna be here, are you?

26
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,083
Sucks to be you!

27
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,625
I'll be living it up
in London,

28
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,416
seeing the sights,
eating Indian food.

29
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,666
Enjoy getting laser burn.

30
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,708
Oh, you're gonna be gone
the whole time?

31
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,750
All friggin' week?

32
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:10,583
Two.

33
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,333
All of Matt's spring break.

34
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,041
The boy is obsessed
with The Beatles.

35
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,375
He wants to go
to Abbey Road,

36
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,583
he wants to visit
Apple Records.

37
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,392
I might even get to see
some things I want to see,

38
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:20,250
if we have time.

39
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,250
And it's just the two of you?

40
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,750
You sure about that, Steve?

41
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,125
I thought you two
hated each other

42
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,791
with the burning fury
of a thousand suns.

43
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,958
Well, maybe a hundred.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,833
I mean, Matt,
he had it rough, you know,

45
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,250
but he's really
pulled himself together.

46
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,750
With what you told me
that kid was doing?

47
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,250
The stealing, the drugs?

48
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,125
How'd you turn that around?

49
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,500
Good morning.

50
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,750
It wasn't easy.

51
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,791
The thing is,

52
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:48,976
when Molly and I
first got together,

53
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,125
he was living with his dad,

54
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,583
and he was just running wild.

55
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,250
Kid was a real asshole.

56
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,000
You saw the shiner he gave me.

57
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,833
That's all behind us now.

58
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,208
He stared down his demons,
and he...

59
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,125
damn it, he conquered them.

60
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,875
I've never done anything
that hard in my life.

61
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,250
We're so damn proud
of the guy...

62
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,416
of the man that he's becoming.

63
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,333
So he wants to go to London,

64
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,666
Molly and I scraped together
enough to make it happen.

65
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,750
We wanted to show him

66
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,583
how much we appreciate
all his hard work.

67
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,583
I never had a kid of my own.

68
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,684
I wasn't there
when he was born.

69
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,750
I didn't teach him
how to ride a bike,

70
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,791
or throw a ball...

71
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,000
...but in a few months,

72
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,791
when he walks
across that stage,

73
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,250
and accepts that diploma...

74
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,875
...that is my son.

75
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,583
Oh, you... you just take
all the time you need.

76
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,416
Why don't I just
make some hot cocoa

77
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,083
to cheer up my sweet boy?

78
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,125
Come on, like you're not
crying on my shoulder

79
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,875
every time you don't get
a second date?

80
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,166
What was...

81
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,250
We were supposed
to be inside.

82
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,625
I should never have trusted

83
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,291
the flawed calculations
of a clone.

84
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,291
Clone?

85
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,708
I am not!

86
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,750
This was always
the plan.

87
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,333
The president
is targeting us,

88
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,250
so we shatter the illusion
of his safety.

89
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,041
It's not enough
for us to kill him.

90
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,458
It has to be a spectacle.

91
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,000
You'd know this
if you were truly the original.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,625
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god...

93
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,916
Refreshing.

94
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:52,958
Kind of tickles.

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,833
Mm, I prefer
a higher caliber.

96
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,458
Huh?

97
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,875
I order...

98
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,541
I order...

99
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,041
I order you...

100
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,541
You order what?

101
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,250
Kill that one
and move on!

102
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,166
Your eye is as replaceable
as you are.

103
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,166
I am the original!

104
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,666
Steve, look out!

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,291
Sorry I'm late!

106
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,125
Red Rush,
get this guy out of here!

107
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,375
Focus on evac!

108
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,541
We can deal with these two
once the area is clear!

109
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,041
We can take it from here!

110
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,625
Fall back, help us
evacuate civilians!

111
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,625
Yes, ma'am!

112
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,833
Damn it! Run!

113
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,666
War Woman...

114
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,041
Please, you couldn't just
sit this one out?

115
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,875
Let us kill the President?

116
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,208
Haven't you earned a day off?

117
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,250
Not our style.

118
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,291
Sorry.

119
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,583
This isn't
a spectator sport!

120
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,625
Move!

121
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,916
No!

122
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,028
Stay together, stay together,
stay together, stay together!

123
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,833
Don't move.

124
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:25,958
You're safe now.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I got 'em!

126
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,875
They're in the clear.

127
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,541
- You are on President duty.
- On it.

128
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,291
Sorry, I wouldn't normally
move so fast,

129
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,434
but there were
so many of you that...

130
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,250
Oh, no.

131
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,476
It starts with one of you,
then it...

132
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,375
Oh! Sorry.

133
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,458
I can't...

134
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,625
Huh?

135
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:04,791
Now!

136
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,083
While he's distracted!

137
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,291
This floor looks clear.

138
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,500
I'll go up,
you go down.

139
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
I've got you.

140
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,541
We're gonna be fine.

141
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,000
We'll get out of this.

142
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:13,708
No, no,
what about you?

143
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,708
Behind you.

144
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,791
You're welcome.

145
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,541
Get those soldiers out of here!

146
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,458
We can take it from here.

147
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,666
Too dangerous for you.

148
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,476
When we crush
the Guardians of the Globe

149
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,000
and kill the president,

150
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,500
no one will be left
to stop us!

151
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,541
Take my hand!

152
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,208
I had him.

153
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,083
Ah. All clear.

154
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,791
The building is clear.

155
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,750
It's just us.

156
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:22,916
Evacuation complete.

157
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:23,958
Now we can cut loose

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,208
and focus on
taking these brutes down.

159
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,541
Ah!

160
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,208
Ah!

161
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:00,916
Ah!

162
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,416
Ah!

163
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,083
Mom? What!

164
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,125
I'll be out in a minute!

165
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,750
I don't have
a minute.

166
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,583
Mom!

167
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,666
My bathroom's
out of soap.

168
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,083
Get over yourself.

169
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,916
I used to change
your diapers, kid.

170
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:28,791
There's nothing
going on down there

171
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:29,666
I haven't seen before.

172
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,583
Just get out!

173
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,166
As you can see,

174
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,333
the scene is absolute chaos
as the Mauler twins...

175
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,250
Looks like
Dad's saving the White House.

176
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,125
Alone?

177
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,416
Guardians are there, too.

178
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,000
Who are they fighting?

179
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,916
Ugh, Mauler Twins.

180
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,351
Looks like we won't be
getting breakfast together

181
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,333
this morning.

182
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,333
Bummer.

183
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,750
It's the White House, Mom.

184
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,000
Kind of important.

185
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,833
Oh, they rebuild that thing
twice a year at this point.

186
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,916
If it's not Doc Seismic,

187
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,708
it's the Lizard League,
or someone else.

188
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,310
I doubt the President
still lives there.

189
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,500
I'm not too late!

190
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,750
I'm gonna shower.

191
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,166
Not so fast.

192
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,333
Come here first.

193
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Don't make me
get the spray bottle.

194
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,125
Now, let's get you
out of that costume.

195
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,583
Boundaries, people!

196
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,500
Bathroom doors
are closed for a reason,

197
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,267
and parents should never,
ever talk about sex

198
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,000
in front of their kids!

199
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,458
You should be overjoyed
to see your parents

200
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,166
passionately expressing
their love for each other.

201
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,583
Now stop griping.

202
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,750
Get ready for school.

203
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,416
Couldn't you at least wait
until I leave the house...

204
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,791
for college!

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,541
What were you thinking?

206
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,458
Paris?

207
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,601
Actually,
I was kind of pulling

208
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,958
for that little cafe
in Berlin.

209
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,250
I've been jonesing
for those sausages.

210
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,767
Aw, man, you guys
are going to Best Wurst?

211
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,333
I love that place!

212
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,541
You've got school.

213
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,583
When your powers kick in,
you can go on your own.

214
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,166
Salt on the wound, Dad.

215
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,875
They've gotta be due
any day now, son.

216
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,916
Even the latest bloomers
on Viltrum

217
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:00,916
would get their powers

218
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,458
before what would be
their 18th birthday.

219
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,541
You'll see.

220
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,863
Don't get his hopes up.

221
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:10,958
Bye!

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,458
Have fun!

223
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,666
I'll just be walking,

224
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,708
on the ground,

225
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,625
with my feet.

226
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,541
Morning.

227
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,958
Uh, just, uh...

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,166
just trying to break in
these new shoes.

229
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,083
Ugh!

230
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,750
Mauler Twins
attack the White House?

231
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:53,791
Nuts, right?

232
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,833
I saw.

233
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,392
I can't believe
the Guardians of the Globe

234
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,166
let them get that close
to killing the President.

235
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,726
They didn't even get
into the building,

236
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,375
and Omni-Man was there, too.

237
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,916
You're such
an Omni-Maniac.

238
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,500
Way to root
for the underdog.

239
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,750
Big fan of the Yankees,
are you?

240
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,833
Sure, he's hot and all,

241
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,333
and that mustache...

242
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:14,625
Sorry!

243
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,375
Okay, straight stuff.

244
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,875
You up for some
Clash Crash tonight?

245
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,750
I'm hoping for a Level 43
chest armor.

246
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,375
Don't bring up
that stupid job, man.

247
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,583
Don't be that person.

248
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,226
When's the last time
you bought a comic book?

249
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,666
Those things are expensive,

250
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,416
and they're doing Seance Dog
twice a month all summer.

251
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,333
You're into
the stupidest stuff.

252
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,750
Knock it off, Todd!

253
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,166
Come on...

254
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,375
Quit playing games.

255
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,666
I know you're crazy about me.

256
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,250
Marcy told me.

257
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,250
Well, you are
big and strong, aren't you?

258
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,250
You know it.

259
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,166
And you think
that makes it okay

260
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,625
for you to harass me?

261
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,500
Hey, don't walk away from me.

262
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,250
What, are you
a lesbian or something?

263
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,833
Oh, my god, I wish!

264
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,333
Would you
leave me alone then?

265
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,458
Let go of me,

266
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,250
so I can go find
a girl to kiss!

267
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,291
Don't.

268
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,666
Guy's twice your size.

269
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,017
Maybe you can just
sit back and watch this?

270
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,000
I can't.

271
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,041
I can because
I'm not Omni-Man,

272
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,458
and neither are you.

273
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,958
Let's see.

274
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,458
I think Amber's
been pretty clear

275
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,708
about how she feels, Todd.

276
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,708
Are you serious, Grayson?

277
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,750
Look...

278
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,333
Leave him alone!

279
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,916
What are you lookin' at?

280
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,125
Thank you.

281
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,166
Yup.

282
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,416
Close one.

283
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,458
Huh.

284
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,291
It's about time.

285
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,083
And a big welcome home
to my favorite son.

286
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,291
I made some chicken,

287
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,375
but I also heated up
some authentic German bratwurst

288
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,458
flown in special today,

289
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,458
just for you.

290
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,750
I... had
a pretty interesting day.

291
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,250
Sorry I'm late.

292
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,833
Honest to god, a dragon
was attacking Hong Kong.

293
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:49,708
I stopped it.

294
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,166
Ooh, a dragon.
Nice.

295
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,583
Mark was getting ready
to tell us

296
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,083
how interesting
his day was.

297
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,666
Guess who's finally
getting his powers?

298
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,416
Are you sure?

299
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,041
Pretty sure.

300
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,583
Threw a trash bag into space
at work.

301
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,416
Oh, that's great, Son,

302
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,666
just great!

303
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:11,791
If you're up for it,

304
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,017
I'll make some time
tomorrow for training.

305
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,125
This is so exciting!

306
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,351
Bright and early
tomorrow, Mark.

307
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,767
Make sure you get
a good night's sleep.

308
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,333
Ha! For sure!

309
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,916
Okay, Son, bear with me...

310
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,000
This is gonna be a little
awkward for both of us.

311
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,416
You may have noticed

312
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,916
that I'm not like
normal dads.

313
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,833
Your mother and I think
it's time you knew the truth.

314
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,708
We think you're old enough
for me to tell you

315
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,333
where I really come from.

316
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,375
Millions of miles from here,

317
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,916
out in deep space,

318
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,791
is the planet Viltrum...

319
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,125
It's a cool blue oasis

320
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,375
alone in a solar system
much like our own.

321
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,208
I was born on this planet.

322
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,083
Viltrumites
are very similar to humans,

323
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,583
except we can fly,

324
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,541
move at super speed,

325
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,125
and possess great strength.

326
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,750
When our people come of age,

327
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,000
we leave Viltrum,

328
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,125
and venture out
into the galaxy,

329
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,375
using our abilities to help
lesser-developed worlds.

330
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,208
I volunteered to relocate
to Earth,

331
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,541
and be its sole protector.

332
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,791
That's when I met
your mother...

333
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,958
and we eventually had you.

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,291
I know this is a lot
to take in at one time,

335
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,541
but you're
half Viltrumite, Son,

336
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,458
and you're getting older.

337
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,958
Things are gonna
start to change for you

338
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,166
in a few years

339
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,541
as you hit puberty.

340
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,333
You're gonna get acne.

341
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,958
Your voice will start to crack
as it begins to change.

342
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,541
You'll begin to grow hair
in strange places,

343
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,000
and you're gonna start
to develop superpowers

344
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,541
of your own.

345
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,541
Just like me,

346
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,458
super strength and speed,

347
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,291
flight, the whole bit.

348
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,291
Do you understand?

349
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,375
I'm gonna be able to fly?

350
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,916
Yes, Son,

351
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:20,583
you're gonna be able to fly...

352
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,083
I'm gonna be able to fly.

353
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,500
Whew.

354
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,666
Don't look down...

355
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,583
Stop looking down!

356
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,250
I'm not going down.

357
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,250
I'm gonna fly up,

358
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,333
because I can fly.

359
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,041
What if I can't yet?

360
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,291
No, no, no, okay.

361
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,166
Dad always said
it was like a reflex,

362
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,083
so if I don't want to fall,
I won't,

363
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,541
and even if I do,
maybe it won't even hurt,

364
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,291
or maybe...

365
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,291
Ah, screw it!

366
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,125
Whoo-hoo!

367
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,125
Whoa... oh, crap.

368
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,166
Whoa! Oh, god...

369
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,583
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

370
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,125
Ugh!

371
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,083
No, no, no, no, no...

372
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,250
Put some pants on,

373
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,625
and let's get
in the sky, my boy.

374
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,375
I'll... put some coffee on.

375
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,625
It's kinda like
how you walk,

376
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,875
and you don't think about
balancing anymore,

377
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,916
but when you were a baby,
you did.

378
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,625
You're a baby flier right now.

379
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,958
You have to focus
on staying upright,

380
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,041
focus on going
the direction you want to go.

381
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,125
Understand?

382
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:40,958
Yeah.

383
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,625
I think I got it.

384
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,625
It doesn't look like you do.

385
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,666
Follow me.

386
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,666
No, no...

387
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,416
You can wear yourself out
flying.

388
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,041
Moving fast
is like tensing a muscle.

389
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,125
You're much better off

390
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,750
if you relax that muscle
from time to time,

391
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:07,208
use the momentum you're building
to carry you forward.

392
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,375
Okay, you don't want to fall,

393
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,875
so you're gonna have trouble
relaxing.

394
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,958
It's kind of like
peeing your pants on purpose.

395
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,958
What?

396
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,416
Peeing your pants on purpose.

397
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,958
You know, you spend
your whole life

398
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,750
trying not to pee your pants,

399
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,333
so letting go,
peeing your pants on purpose,

400
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,625
it's next to impossible.

401
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,083
How how do you know this?

402
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,791
Who would try that?

403
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,333
You are far better at flying
than you should be.

404
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,625
Late-night practice?

405
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,958
Is that why you're so tired?

406
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,309
Don't try to change
the subject.

407
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,833
Land over there.

408
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,125
Slow down.

409
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,458
Land. I said, land.

410
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,708
Why aren't you slowing down?

411
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,625
I can't!

412
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,125
Stop. Just stop!

413
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,041
Okay.

414
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,517
I guess that still counts
as a landing.

415
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,375
Get up.

416
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,500
Come on, we're gonna try
something else.

417
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,221
I'm actually getting
used to this a little.

418
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,708
That's not good.

419
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,541
Try to hit me.

420
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,458
- Really?
- Yeah.

421
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,041
Use your whole body.

422
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,458
You can punch with your arm,

423
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,375
but if you punch
with your shoulder,

424
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,625
your hips,
and your legs as well,

425
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,208
it'll be much more powerful.

426
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,850
It'll take a while
to get the hang of it.

427
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:27,791
Okay.

428
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,166
Now, with us,

429
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,375
we can freely move ourselves
through physical space.

430
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,333
That's how we fly.

431
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,541
So we don't have to pivot
on our feet

432
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,208
and push off the ground.

433
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,375
We can literally
push off anything.

434
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,541
We can create our own leverage.

435
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,125
Good...

436
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,958
but try it
a little more like this.

437
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,291
Like what?

438
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,041
Dad...

439
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,041
You hurt me.

440
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,916
I know, Son.

441
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:08,958
I didn't...

442
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,875
I didn't mean
to hit you so hard.

443
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,791
I'm sorry.

444
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Why did you do that?

445
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:16,875
Mark...

446
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,500
if you really wanna do

447
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,833
what I do,

448
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,375
you have to be prepared
for anything.

449
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,916
No one is gonna
pull their punches.

450
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,833
So...

451
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,875
how badly did that go?

452
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:45,833
I pushed him pretty far.

453
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,708
It's what he needs.

454
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,875
Did you maybe
push too far?

455
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,125
Are you questioning me?

456
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:54,083
What the hell
has gotten into you?

457
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,750
I don't know.

458
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:57,583
I...

459
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,875
I'm sorry.

460
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:03,708
Mark got his powers so late,
I wasn't prepared for this.

461
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,333
It changes things.

462
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,833
I can't help but think,

463
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,750
maybe our lives
would be better

464
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,666
if he hadn't
gotten them at all.

465
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,833
Jeez, man.

466
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,101
You still sore
from Todd's thrashing?

467
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,083
What's up?

468
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,458
Huh?

469
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,666
No, I'm fine.

470
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:22,916
Okay, man.

471
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,333
You sure look fine.

472
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,500
Hey, Mark Grayson...

473
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,958
...and I don't see Amber
anywhere nearby

474
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,666
to protect your sorry ass.

475
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,791
Todd, please.

476
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,208
Just don't...

477
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,041
Don't?

478
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,125
Don't what?

479
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,708
Don't kick your ass again?

480
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,625
Or what?
Are you threatening me?

481
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,625
Or do you need a replay
of what happened last time, ass?

482
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,291
Hit me.

483
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,375
Go on.

484
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,791
Hit me as hard as you can.

485
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,208
Again.

486
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,583
Again.

487
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,250
Harder.

488
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,583
Freak!

489
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,791
Dude, what is up with you?

490
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,333
I need something to punch.

491
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,875
He just walked away, Mark!

492
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,333
You missed your chance.

493
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,541
Gunfire...

494
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,458
Where did the gunfire go?

495
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,583
There!

496
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,791
Whoa...

497
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:43,875
Dammit.

498
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,333
Let's go!

499
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,458
You're not supposed
to run with us, you idiot!

500
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,750
You're supposed
to stay behind

501
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,458
so we can get away!

502
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,392
You brought me along
to protect you from the cops.

503
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:04,375
I can't do that

504
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,958
if I hang back
and let them shoot me.

505
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,625
Shut up
and get us over the fence!

506
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,916
Huh?

507
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,250
Meant to do that.

508
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,625
Who the hell are you?

509
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:24,166
I'm...

510
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,041
Uh...

511
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,250
I'm...

512
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,791
I guess I'm working
on that.

513
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:28,916
Any suggestions?

514
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:31,416
Captain Guy with a hole
punched through him?

515
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,458
Doesn't really
roll off the tongue.

516
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,500
Anything else?

517
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:06,625
Huh, what about Ass Kicker?

518
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,750
No...

519
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,083
that sounds
willfully childish.

520
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:09,958
What are you thinking?

521
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,875
You look ridiculous.

522
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:16,125
Let's get outta here.

523
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,375
Whoa...

524
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:21,416
Oof!

525
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,500
Honestly,

526
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,875
I think you might have
skipped a few steps, Mark.

527
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:29,875
Seemed to work out just fine.

528
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,375
It may not
look like much,

529
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:33,583
but you did far more
damage down there

530
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,958
than you needed to.

531
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,375
I don't think
you're ready.

532
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,208
Hit me.

533
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,291
What?

534
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,458
Hit me now.
Do it!

535
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,875
I wasn't ready before.

536
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:43,791
Now I am.

537
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,041
I can take it.

538
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,625
Come on!

539
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,791
I'm not gonna hit you.

540
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,017
You'd never
hit me before, okay?

541
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,125
It scared me.

542
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:52,767
It wasn't too much,
I could take the pain.

543
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:53,708
I'm strong.

544
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,041
I know you are.

545
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,083
No, you don't!

546
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,791
I know you think
I can't do this!

547
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,416
Hit me, and let me
prove you wrong!

548
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:00,750
Please, Dad!

549
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02,125
Please just hit me.

550
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,708
Oh, Son...

551
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,333
I'm strong enough,
and I can do this!

552
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,791
It's all I ever wanted
for as long as I can remember.

553
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:12,708
I wanna do what you do.

554
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,375
I wanna be just like you.

555
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,875
You will be, Son.

556
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:22,416
You will.

557
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:28,000
Let me make this up to you.

558
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,583
Follow me.

559
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,267
You're taking me shopping?

560
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,000
I am.

561
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,250
Were you seen?

562
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:55,958
Who are you talking to?

563
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,541
Sorry, sorry.

564
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,791
Just need to ask.

565
00:27:58,833 --> 00:27:59,750
Whoa...

566
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:02,083
Prom dresses by day,

567
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:05,416
indestructible super suits
by night.

568
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,166
I'm Art Rosenbaum, kid.

569
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:08,791
Pleasure to finally meet you.

570
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,666
I've heard so much
about you.

571
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,708
You, too.

572
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,791
Heh.

573
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,583
Your dad's never
mentioned me, has he?

574
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:16,916
Well, I...

575
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:17,958
He's a teenager, Art.

576
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,125
He barely remembers anything

577
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,916
he doesn't see in the mirror
every morning.

578
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,375
Wait, super suits?

579
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:24,916
Am I getting
a costume?

580
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,500
Do you make
Dad's costumes?

581
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,000
He's a quick one,
this kid.

582
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,226
I can't have you
running around in your pajamas

583
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,083
all the time.

584
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,458
Oh, man!

585
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,625
Awesome!

586
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:34,101
Wait, do you already
have one made for me?

587
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,125
Is it a surprise?

588
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,083
Usually, we start
with a conversation,

589
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,083
and I make something custom,

590
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,333
but I do have one
that might work.

591
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,250
What do you think?

592
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,333
Well...

593
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,041
I don't know about
the orange and yellow.

594
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:49,958
It's pretty loud.

595
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,833
Dad?

596
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,000
Not your best work, Art.

597
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,750
Can't blame a guy

598
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:57,250
for trying to move
unsold merchandise.

599
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,541
I like the goggles.

600
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,958
They'd keep the wind
out of my eyes when I fly,

601
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,166
but I was really, like,
hoping for something more, uh...

602
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,166
I don't know...

603
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:07,166
iconic?

604
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,791
Of course you were.

605
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,666
That's what everyone wants.

606
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:11,583
Iconic.

607
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,666
A symbol.

608
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,291
Something kids
will draw

609
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,833
in the margins
of their notebooks

610
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:18,916
while they daydream about
being as cool as you.

611
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,583
It's also tough as hell
to pull off,

612
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,916
but listen,

613
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,875
your dad being who he is,

614
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:25,875
I'm willing to put
a lot of elbow grease

615
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:26,958
into this one...

616
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,333
but I'm gonna need
a little help from you.

617
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,083
Have you decided on a name yet?

618
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,083
I haven't really
thought about it.

619
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,833
Well, having a name helps.

620
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,875
Darkwing has dark wings,

621
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:39,583
the Red Rush is a red rush
when he runs by you.

622
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,666
You get it?

623
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:41,958
You give me
something to go on,

624
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,541
I'll strive for iconic.

625
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,000
Think about it
and get back to me.

626
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,833
Mark?

627
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:00,416
Mark?

628
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,208
Mark?

629
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:24,333
What the hell was that?

630
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:26,541
Uh...

631
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:27,833
practicing my landings?

632
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:30,500
Yeah, I see that now.

633
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:31,458
Yeah, uh...

634
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,000
sorry about the yard.

635
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,250
What are you doing?

636
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,916
I need practice, Mom.

637
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:39,000
I can't land well,
I can't fly all that fast.

638
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:39,833
I need to be better.

639
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:42,083
Mark, you need to sleep.

640
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,583
I need to practice.

641
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,851
Honey it's the middle
of the night.

642
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,958
I have work tomorrow,
you have school.

643
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,500
Get inside right now.

644
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Make me.

645
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,583
Does that make you feel strong?

646
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:56,041
To know I can't physically
make you do something?

647
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,500
Is that what you need?

648
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,458
This is important.

649
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,750
Remember when
you were little,

650
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,250
and we'd talk
almost every night

651
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:08,750
before you went to bed?

652
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:09,916
You'd tell me

653
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:12,375
about whatever jerk
made fun of your hair,

654
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,583
and I'd tell you about
all the girl drama

655
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:15,666
I lived through

656
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,708
so you'd feel better?

657
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:18,875
I can't talk to you

658
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,541
while we soar
through the clouds,

659
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:23,708
but... but I'm still here.

660
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,500
It used to be
you and me,

661
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:28,916
and this crazy
world-saving,

662
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,375
super-powered
father of yours.

663
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:33,458
Now it's you and him,

664
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,791
and your boring, old,
normal mom.

665
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:36,791
Mom...

666
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:37,791
It's okay, sweetheart.

667
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,083
I get it.

668
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:42,416
You have to move away
from the normal life with me,

669
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,416
and get used to being...

670
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:45,583
something more,

671
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:46,791
like your dad.

672
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,083
Yeah, but see,
that's what I'm worried about.

673
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,208
I'm nothing like Dad.

674
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,916
I'm more like you.

675
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:54,333
I'm nothing special.

676
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,416
Oh...

677
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,375
Like a knife to the heart
with this one.

678
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:00,958
Ah... crap.

679
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,291
You know what I mean.

680
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,958
After everything he's done,

681
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,291
how could I possibly
live up to all that?

682
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,791
Who says you have to?

683
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:12,000
You don't have to be
the greatest Omni-Man ever.

684
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:15,541
You just have to be
the greatest you.

685
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:18,541
And what if the greatest me
isn't enough?

686
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,208
Mark, you stupid boy.

687
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,541
How could the greatest you
not be enough?

688
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,750
Thank you.

689
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,166
I love my boring,

690
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:28,500
powerless, everyday,
run-of-the-mill Mom.

691
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:32,000
And I love my asshole son.

692
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:46,458
You seem tired.

693
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,541
I'm fine.

694
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:51,500
Just got...
a lot on my mind, I guess.

695
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:54,833
Oh, yeah?

696
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,666
So, what is it?

697
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,375
You're just gonna keep prying

698
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:01,666
if I'm evasive at all,
so, um...

699
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,416
I'm scared, Dad.

700
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,833
What if I can't do this?

701
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:11,083
You hear it?

702
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:11,916
I do.

703
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:13,333
Get ready.

704
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,500
Were you nervous?

705
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,750
A little.

706
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:19,916
But you caught it?

707
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,708
I did.

708
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,500
Being a superhero
is no different.

709
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,666
This is the beginning
of a long journey

710
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:26,958
for you and me.

711
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,791
Along the way,

712
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:29,892
you're gonna need
to do things

713
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,750
you don't want to do,

714
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,708
or might not think
you can do.

715
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,041
It's okay to be scared.

716
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:38,250
It's natural
to doubt yourself,

717
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:39,791
but if you can
push through that,

718
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,708
and do what needs to be done,

719
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,916
you'll do just fine.

720
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,958
Do you think
you can do that, Mark?

721
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:47,916
Yeah.

722
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,125
Son...

723
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,458
kids your age
think they're invincible,

724
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,416
and it holds them back,

725
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,625
makes them careless.

726
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,625
The thing is...

727
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,625
you're different.

728
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,500
You actually are...

729
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,291
invincible.

730
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:19,875
Got it.

731
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,750
Okay, kid.

732
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,125
Let's get to work.

733
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:01,375
♪ I was born on the wrong side
of the train tracks ♪

734
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:04,416

You guys think
you might have bitten off

750
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,458
more than you can chew?

751
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,416
That building
has a hole in it, look!

752
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:22,000
Shit!

753
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:37,916
Whoa...

754
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,000
All clear?

755
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:41,083
Whoo!

756
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:48,041
Ow!

757
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,416
Huh?

758
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,916
You might as well give up.

759
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:08,958
I'm...

760
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:20,000
I just mean,
he is a fish person.

761
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:22,291
I think you should maybe
be nicer to him.

762
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,458
It must be hard for him
to make friends.

763
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,041
He's got a whole ocean
of friends,

764
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,500
but you're right, I'll...

765
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,291
Run!

766
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,083
I want to see fear in your eyes!

767
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:36,166
The same fear...

768
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:37,833
What is this?

769
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:39,208
I do my best

770
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,333
to make friends
with the guy.

771
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,500
Josef!

772
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:43,416
You promised!

773
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:45,666
Huh? Oh, crap.

774
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,041
How is this going to work

775
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:50,416
if I can't hold your interest
through one conversation?

776
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:51,583
Hold my interest?

777
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:52,791
Olga, please.

778
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,833
You can't see things how I do.

779
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,750
My perception
is just as fast as I am.

780
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,541
The briefest conversation
with anyone

781
00:37:58,583 --> 00:37:59,916
seems like hours to me.

782
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,166
It's agony.

783
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:08,333
But with you, it's a gift.

784
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:11,750
Your voice is like music.

785
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,708
You're thoughtful,
compassionate,

786
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,375
beautiful woman.

787
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:18,625
I hang on every word.

788
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:20,333
Hmm.

789
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,875
You mean that?

790
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:22,750
I do.

791
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,208
That's...

792
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,708
Guardians emergency.

793
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,708
I'm so very sorry.

794
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,125
I understand.

795
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:32,541
Go.

796
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,250
Denver is toast, Immortal!

797
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:46,708
I'm going out,

798
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,708
and I'm taking
the whole city with me!

799
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,458
I've lined my suit

800
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,916
with plutonium!

801
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,583
When in doubt,
throw them into space.

802
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,708
Huh?

803
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:20,500
Finally, some action!

804
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,250
Holly, wait up!

805
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:30,208
Please, Connie,

806
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,791
don't waste
any more of my time.

807
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,833
This is good news.

808
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,541
With our third quarter roll-out
of Haven Storm 4.0,

809
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,125
our market share should rise
by a minimum of 10%.

810
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:42,666
We have a spectacular year
ahead of us.

811
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:43,916
The new roll-out
of Haven Storm

812
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:45,375
was supposed
to be free.

813
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,625
I'm not worried
about the shareholders' year.

814
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:49,875
I want a spectacular year
for the world.

815
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,625
Don't you do enough
for the world?

816
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,041
None of us do.

817
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,916
Come on!

818
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,583
Come on, you're almost there!

819
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,166
You got this!

820
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,000
You did it!
You did it!

821
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:21,833
Oh, crap.
Sorry!

822
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:26,083
Okay, got it.

823
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,625
Are you okay?

824
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:33,791
I am fine.

825
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:34,791
We did it.

826
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,333
I'd never expanded myself
to that extent.

827
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:39,458
That was... intense.

828
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,583
Aw, man, take me with you.

829
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:44,958
Come on, I can help!

830
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,166
No, Nikki.

831
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,750
You know Guardians' business
is too dangerous

832
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:50,833
for human children.

833
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:51,958
Oh, man...

834
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,142
Aw, you're doing
so good. That's it!

835
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,416
Ooh, yes, like that.
Like that!

836
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:58,333
Keep going.

837
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,625
Aw, yes, yes, yes,

838
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,666
hold that, hold that.

839
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,625
What is that beeping?

840
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:07,250
Uh...

841
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:08,250
That's a wrap.

842
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:09,291
Uh, great work, everyone!

843
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:24,375
We're in.

844
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:25,375
Uh... Sam?

845
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,375
What?

846
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:27,416
Darkwing.

847
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:28,958
Don't worry about him.

848
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,583
He can't be everywhere.

849
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:37,666
Luckily,
I don't have to be everywhere.

850
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,583
Only where I'm needed.

851
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,291
I know
what's in this building,

852
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,750
and I know who wants it.

853
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:07,958
Tell me about your boss.

854
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:10,708
We look like rats to you?

855
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,166
I'll check back with you
tomorrow.

856
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:19,750
Wing Jet.

857
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,208
Darkwing,

858
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,916
why did you call us here?

859
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:47,166
Me?

860
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:48,916
So none of us
signaled the alert?

861
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:50,750
Oh, god, what's going on?

862
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:51,666
Is it bad?

863
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:55,500
Huh?

864
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:11,833
Omni-Man?

865
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:01,916
- No!
- No!

866
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,000
Why have you done this?

867
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:14,416
Ah!

868
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,625
Oh, no.

869
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:44,083
Are you all right?

870
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,375
I live.

871
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,375
Someone must be
controlling him.

872
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:49,375
He would never do this.

873
00:44:49,416 --> 00:44:52,375
Regardless, it's him or us.

874
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,875
I choose us.

875
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,000
Ah!

876
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,500
Why?

877
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:56,083
Why!
