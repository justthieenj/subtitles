1
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,250
Shit.

2
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,500
Look at that place.

3
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,500
Language.

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:25,500
Sorry.

5
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,458
I mean, it's impressive,

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,041
but, like, who needs
that many rooms?

7
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,416
It's not about rooms.

8
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,000
It's about power.

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,000
That building has one purpose.

10
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,666
To say, "I'm the Queen,
and you are my subjects."

11
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,000
Huh.

12
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,375
You think so?

13
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,333
The Queen might look
like a nice old lady,

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,583
but she comes from
a long line of tyrants

15
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,434
who all thought they were
better than the rest of us.

16
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,208
Dad!

17
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,541
I didn't know
they had Burger Marts here.

18
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,791
You called me Dad.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,041
Clear.

20
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,351
Go, go, go!
Get in there!

21
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,333
One team per casualty!

22
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,291
- Move it!
- Jesus Christ.

23
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,708
What the hell happened here?

24
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,470
Applying aqueous sealant.

25
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,750
Is that part of her brain?

26
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:56,958
It's the Green Ghost!

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,184
Did you find all the pieces?

28
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,642
I used
to worship this guy as a kid.

29
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,726
Get those on ice.

30
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,059
Cut in the neck now.

31
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,041
Watch out.

32
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,583
Sometimes, it affects
the spinal...

33
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,208
Beginning nano-suscitation.

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,791
Locking in neural stabilizer.

35
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,309
Omni-Man's alive!

36
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,750
Get out of the way!

37
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,916
Hurry up!

38
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,583
It's all we can do here.

39
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,083
Get ready for transport.

40
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,083
Go, go, go!

41
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,458
Careful.
Don't bump her.

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,125
Never seen anything like this.

43
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,833
Goddammit!

44
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,208
Hey, Mom.

45
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,708
What's wrong?

46
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,666
Nothing.

47
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,208
Just missing your dad.

48
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,625
He didn't come home last night.

49
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,166
Mom, stop worrying.

50
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,934
He probably got buried
under a mountain again

51
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,333
or something.

52
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,875
Well, it wouldn't be
the first time.

53
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,166
Don't be late for school.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,541
Nolan's receiving
the absolute pinnacle of care.

55
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,583
As the Global Defense Agency,

56
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,625
we have access
to medical technology

57
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,958
far beyond any normal hospital.

58
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,458
Whoa...

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,851
Ah, that's one of
our threat-response teams.

60
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,416
They're able to get anywhere...

61
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,500
We're not in the mood
for the tour, Donald.

62
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,833
Sorry, Debbie.

63
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,166
My dad never mentioned
you guys.

64
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,791
That's the idea.

65
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,833
We work with superheroes
like your father

66
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,083
to keep the world safe.

67
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,045
Who knows, maybe someday,
we'll even work with...

68
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,916
Oh, my god, Nolan!

69
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,958
Dad!

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,708
He's gonna be okay, right?

71
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,541
We... hope so,

72
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,416
and our doctors
are doing their best,

73
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,833
but we don't get a lot
of Viltrumites in here.

74
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,166
Who did this?

75
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,625
We have no idea.

76
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,166
Not yet, anyway,

77
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,208
but we'll find out,

78
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,791
and when we do,

79
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,892
they're gonna look
a hell of a lot worse

80
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,708
than your dad right over there.

81
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,750
Cecil Steadman.

82
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,833
Director of the GDA.

83
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,083
Deborah,

84
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,166
I'm so sorry.

85
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,000
Cecil,

86
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,333
you've got a lot of nerve.

87
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,101
Someone murdered the Guardians
of the Globe last night.

88
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:50,916
Oh, my god.

89
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,000
All of them.

90
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,458
Tore 'em limb from limb.

91
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,208
Now, we tried like hell
to bring 'em back,

92
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,375
but Nolan was
the only survivor.

93
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,750
How is that even possible?

94
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,208
We don't know yet.

95
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,916
We also don't know why
your dad was at Guardians' HQ.

96
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:04,916
Now, working theory is,

97
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,125
whoever killed the Guardians
lured him there,

98
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,750
tried to wipe 'em
all out at once.

99
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,625
- Why?
- Why?

100
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, that's the easy part.

101
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,267
There isn't
a super-villain alive

102
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,517
who doesn't want Omni-Man
and the Guardians

103
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,791
six feet under.

104
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,559
Now, we're keeping this
all hush-hush for now,

105
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,750
but news will break.

106
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,333
I wanted you and Mark
to know first.

107
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,583
Cold towels,

108
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,791
and ice water,

109
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,267
and have a cot
brought in here for me.

110
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,166
Deborah, we've got
the best-trained...

111
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,500
I've patched Nolan up
for 20 years, Cecil.

112
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,541
I am not leaving.

113
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,833
Of-of course, Debbie.

114
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,166
Sir...

115
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,583
There's some kind of attack
happening downtown, it seems.

116
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,958
Numerous contacts.
Heavy weaponry.

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,875
Multiple casualties.

118
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,041
Now?

119
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,791
We're a little understaffed
in the hero department.

120
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,375
Holy shit.

121
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,541
Get it together, Mark.

122
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,333
Get it together.

123
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,416
Get in there.

124
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,708
Stop!

125
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,830
Get away from those people!

126
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,791
Oh, shit.

127
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,291
Get it together.

128
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,375
Help me.

129
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,500
No!

130
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:10,625
It's okay.

131
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,625
It's okay, I'm here.

132
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,125
Are you hurt?

133
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,750
Brax moy!

134
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,416
Oh!

135
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,833
Oh, shit!
Oh, my god...

136
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,166
Huh?

137
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,416
Huh?

138
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,666
I don't know who you are,
but it's time to go.

139
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,916
Eve, two and a half
seconds after this sentence,

140
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,250
three enemy tanks will align
50 degrees to your right.

141
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,583
I got it.

142
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,875
Rex...

143
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,250
civilians in danger
to your left.

144
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,500
Uh, yeah,
I got eyes, too, Robot.

145
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,375
Dupli-Kate...

146
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,625
Keep doing what you are doing.

147
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,458
You! Get her to a hospital!

148
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,000
We can handle this.

149
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,708
You're Atom Eve...

150
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,916
What?

151
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:56,916
Just go!

152
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,500
Admirable intention, Eve,

153
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,541
but I am not positive
we can handle this.

154
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,833
Ha! Huh...

155
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,583
Oh.

156
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,250
Uh, guys?

157
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,708
I'm down to pocket change here.

158
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,000
They're killing me
faster than I can keep up.

159
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,125
We gave people time to escape.

160
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,750
That's what matters.

161
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,625
Uh, no.

162
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,958
Me living is what matters.

163
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,125
Then I have bad news.

164
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,625
Ah!

165
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,750
I don't know
what just happened,

166
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,041
but I think I speak
for everyone here

167
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:24,958
when I say

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,958
I never want it to happen
ever again!

169
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,083
Y'ah!

170
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,375
Indeed.

171
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,291
Help!

172
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,208
Anyone!

173
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,125
I need help!

174
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,416
Freeze.

175
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,541
She needs a doctor!

176
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,017
- He's covered in blood.
- Come on!

177
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,250
Give her to us.

178
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,333
Clamp that vein
and get a drip started.

179
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,416
- Prep operating room six.
- Yes, doctor.

180
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,083
He's clear.

181
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,333
Mark!

182
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,083
I tried my best.

183
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,166
I tried to be like Dad.

184
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,916
It's okay.

185
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,125
It's okay.

186
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,708
Hey!

187
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,708
Hey...

188
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,125
Watch it!

189
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,000
Dick...

190
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,208
Hey, Mark.

191
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,125
Mark.

192
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,833
Mark!

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,958
Whoa.

194
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,041
Are you okay?

195
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,916
My dad, um...

196
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,791
he got attacked.

197
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,083
What?

198
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,166
You're kidding.

199
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,541
Oh, god, you're not kidding.

200
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,791
Is-Is he okay?
What happened?

201
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,666
He's in the hospital.

202
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,916
They're doing, uh...

203
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,291
They're doing their best,
but it's...

204
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,625
It's messed up, William.

205
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,583
He's really hurt.

206
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,625
Jesus, Mark.

207
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:04,791
I'm so sorry.

208
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,125
Did they catch who did it?

209
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,875
No, not yet.

210
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,392
Speaking as someone
who's been attacked

211
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,791
in this stupid city,

212
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,916
I'm here for you.

213
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,125
Whatever you need.

214
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,000
You wanna talk, I'll listen.

215
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,875
You and Debbie need a lasagna,
I make a good one.

216
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,875
Actually, I make a great one.

217
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:20,916
Eve Wilkins...

218
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,125
What?

219
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,125
Um...

220
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,458
Yeah, that's her.

221
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,708
I need to talk to her.

222
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,767
You and all the other
straight boys

223
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,958
in a ten-mile radius.

224
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,041
Good luck with that,

225
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,809
and didn't you just get
your ass kicked last week

226
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,791
for Amber Bennett?

227
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,916
Eve?

228
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,750
Hi, uh...

229
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,750
Oh, hey.

230
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,166
Mark, right?

231
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,750
Grayson, yeah.

232
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,250
Um...

233
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,958
thanks for saving
my butt back there.

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,375
Y-Yesterday, I mean.

235
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,583
Yesterday? Oh.

236
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:53,708
Oh!

237
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,333
That was you?

238
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,125
In the blue and the yellow?

239
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,541
Yeah.

240
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,750
That was me.

241
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,416
I'm, um...

242
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,666
Invincible.

243
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,833
God, that sounds dumb
when I say it like that.

244
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,375
It sounds a little
optimistic maybe.

245
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,458
I'm Atom Eve,

246
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,250
but the rest of the team
just calls me Eve.

247
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,375
So does everyone else.

248
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,166
Right, since it's
kind of a normal name,

249
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,625
and not something like...

250
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,708
Invincible?

251
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,958
Invincible, yeah.

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,958
Do you want to talk
about yesterday?

253
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,625
You look like you need
to talk about yesterday.

254
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,809
I heard he just
let Todd hit him.

255
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,916
Like 20 times.

256
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,625
He didn't flinch
or anything.

257
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,083
Todd got so freaked out

258
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,666
he stayed home
for three days.

259
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,250
Are you talking about
Mark Grayson?

260
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,083
Duh. Of course, Amber.

261
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,125
You're the reason
Todd beat him up again.

262
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,666
I never
recognized you before.

263
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,541
No one does.

264
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,833
It's a psychology thing.

265
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,833
If you don't expect to see
a superhero in your school,

266
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,166
you don't see a superhero
in your school.

267
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,416
Hmm.

268
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,416
I even follow Teen Team
on Instagram.

269
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,500
That's us.

270
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,208
Everyone's fourth favorite
superhero team.

271
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,416
I like you guys way better
than Fight Force.

272
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,184
Oh, we're definitely
better than Fight Force.

273
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,666
Those guys are the worst.

274
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,000
They got their asses kicked
by the Lizard League last year.

275
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, I remember
seeing that on TV.

276
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,291
So...

277
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,291
you're new to this, right?

278
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,875
Uh... I just got my powers.

279
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,541
That was my first big fight.

280
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,083
Ah, okay.

281
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:22,916
Explains a lot.

282
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,041
Still, not bad for a rookie.

283
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,041
Are you kidding?

284
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,166
I froze out there.

285
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,375
People got hurt.

286
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:31,166
People escaped because of you,

287
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,583
and everyone freezes
their first time.

288
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,583
I used to throw up
before every fight.

289
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,208
Barf my guts out.

290
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,000
Really?

291
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,875
Like a fire hydrant.

292
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,125
You'll get used to it.

293
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,291
The fights, not the barfing.

294
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,583
Ah...

295
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,333
I just...

296
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,291
It wasn't what I expected.

297
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,208
I figured I'd punch some aliens,

298
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,416
and they'd go home.

299
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,625
It's not how it looks on TV.

300
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,208
No shit.

301
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,583
Thanks.

302
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,416
I charge 250 an hour.

303
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,458
Now I'm kidding.

304
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,333
You are new at this.

305
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,625
Why don't you come by
and meet the Team after school?

306
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,500
Teen Team?

307
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,041
I dunno...

308
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,958
I heard they were only
everyone's fourth favorite.

309
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,958
Meet me out front
after class, Invincible.

310
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,416
You kids did good, Robot.

311
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,666
Thank you, Cecil.

312
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,434
It's an honor to assist
the Global Defense Agency.

313
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,333
Though your use
of the term "kids"

314
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,434
might be considered
condescending.

315
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,041
But a victory?

316
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,208
No.

317
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,166
Do you know how many people
died here yesterday?

318
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,208
338.

319
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,750
338...

320
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,375
and it only stopped there

321
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,250
because whoever the hell
those assholes were, ran away.

322
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,208
- The Flaxans.
- What?

323
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,000
They call themselves
the Flaxans.

324
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,625
I reverse-engineered
their language

325
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,250
using recordings
from the battle.

326
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,375
Any idea why they left

327
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,083
just when they were
kicking our asses?

328
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,500
I have six ideas...

329
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,500
...but I believe that
narrows it down to one.

330
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,291
Oxidized and corroded.

331
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,291
For an alloy like this,
that should take years.

332
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,541
Time runs faster
wherever they come from.

333
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,642
They ran off because they...

334
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,375
Because they were dying
of old age.

335
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,500
Huh.

336
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,791
Well, if they come back,

337
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,416
maybe I'll just
evacuate the area

338
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,458
and wait till they get cancer.

339
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,125
How did that new kid do?

340
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,291
Invincible?

341
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,375
He has promise,

342
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,583
but he seems unprepared

343
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,125
for the more realistic aspects
of super-herodom.

344
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,125
Well, he'd better toughen up.

345
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,333
We're gonna need his help.

346
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,375
Why?

347
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,458
From one giant shitshow
to another.

348
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,291
Give me some good news, Donald.

349
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,625
Whoever did this cut the power
and the backup.

350
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,625
They killed the cameras
and the security systems.

351
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,458
Forensics, frankly, is stumped.

352
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,958
I told them to start over
and try harder.

353
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,958
That's not good news.

354
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,416
That's not good news at all!

355
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,041
I asked you
for some good news, Donald!

356
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,625
Get the hell out.

357
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,125
Everyone.

358
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,375
Come on, you heard the director.
Move it!

359
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,083
Come on out.

360
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,375
I know you're there.

361
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,208
Wasn't hiding.

362
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,291
Sir, who the hell...

363
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,125
Damien Darkblood,
demon detective.

364
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,291
Huh...

365
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,375
Seven superheroes murdered.

366
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:51,166
Strongest man on the planet
almost dead.

367
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,625
No suspects. No leads.

368
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,458
How does he...

369
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,458
I don't know.

370
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,583
Demon magic or something.

371
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,333
If you're asking
if we need your help...

372
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,333
Wasn't asking.

373
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,000
Fine. Knock yourself out.

374
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,125
Help us solve the case,
oh, Great-horned Holmes.

375
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,458
Sir... are you sure?

376
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,125
You got a problem
with the demon?

377
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,458
I thought you were
an atheist, Donald.

378
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,916
Th-theoretically.

379
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,375
Hey.

380
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,458
I heard you took

381
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,875
a few on the chin
for me again.

382
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,291
Oh, hey, Amber.

383
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,875
Uh, yeah, but don't worry,

384
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,142
I've got this amazing
new strategy

385
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,708
for dealing with Todd.

386
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,708
I let him hit me

387
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,875
until he gets bored
and goes home.

388
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,583
Hmm... nice.

389
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,041
He'll never see it coming.

390
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,791
Unfortunately,
neither will your face.

391
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,041
Eh, people always told me
I was too pretty anyway.

392
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,041
I gotta run.

393
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,708
Catch you later?

394
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,666
Ready?

395
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,625
Try to keep up.

396
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:11,875
Eve?

397
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,958
Eve!

398
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,958
Whoa! Shit!

399
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,583
Oof!

400
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:24,833
Okay.

401
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's try this again.

402
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,333
Follow me.

403
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,666
Now what?

404
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,708
Oh!

405
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,875
Cool.

406
00:19:58,916 --> 00:19:59,750
Ha!

407
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,708
Babe.

408
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,291
Oh, hey!

409
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,916
It's the iceman.

410
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,041
Rex...

411
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,833
Couldn't have won
that fight without you.

412
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,916
Oh! Except we did.

413
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:14,875
They got old.

414
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:15,916
And ran away.

415
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,500
Still counts.

416
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,642
Welcome, Invincible.

417
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,041
My name is Robot.

418
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,833
Apologies for Rex Splode.
He's...

419
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,583
Unbelievably awesome.

420
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,500
Incorrigible.

421
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,625
And rude.

422
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,166
And bored of this.

423
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm Dupli-Kate.

424
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,166
Invincible.

425
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,958
Which one of you do I
look at when we talk?

426
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,666
Hey, Robot,
find anything at the site?

427
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,375
The Flaxans
come from a dimension

428
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,375
with a faster temporal rate.

429
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,666
As a result,

430
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,767
the tachyons they emit
spin more rapidly than our own.

431
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:46,625
I've created this detector
to warn us if they return.

432
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,500
Ah, because we almost
missed all the explosions

433
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,875
and the screaming and the chaos.

434
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:55,583
It should give us
a few minutes of early warning.

435
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,625
Cecil and the GDA

436
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,125
have also requested
to call on us

437
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,166
for any possible emergencies.

438
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,250
Since the Guardians
are apparently indisposed,

439
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,916
Invincible, may we count on you
in the future?

440
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,708
You sure you want my help?

441
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,166
Yeah, I mean, of course.

442
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,541
Just text me, I guess.

443
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,416
Oh, right, you need my number.

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I know you don't like
teams much,

445
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,583
but they were all pretty cool.

446
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,250
Except Rex Splode.

447
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,750
I do not know
what that guy's problem is.

448
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,250
I think he and Eve
are a thing maybe.

449
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,416
Who's Eve?

450
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,500
Uh...

451
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,583
No one.

452
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,000
Just-just a friend.

453
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,500
Mm-hmm.

454
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,416
Did you find the dinners
in the freezer?

455
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,333
Yeah.

456
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,333
Thanks, Mom.

457
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,416
Oh, Mark, I'm sorry.

458
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:47,875
I've been so focused on your dad
that I've forgotten about you.

459
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:48,916
Are you okay?

460
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,750
Donald said you saved
a lot of lives.

461
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,208
Yeah. It was just, um...

462
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,416
harder than I thought.

463
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,333
Dad didn't talk about this part
of being a superhero.

464
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,791
Your dad's good at
a lot of things.

465
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,500
Talking about his feelings
isn't one of them...

466
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,583
but we can talk.

467
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,458
Is, uh...
is she okay?

468
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Her name's Maya.

469
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,791
Doesn't she have
any family?

470
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,375
We've contacted them, yes,
but this is a secure facility.

471
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,500
She's not strong enough

472
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,791
for us to transfer her
to a normal hospital.

473
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,458
But she'll be okay?

474
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,916
Well, it's too soon to tell,
but I hope so.

475
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,833
Whoo!

476
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,291
Is this supposed to be
doing that?

477
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,750
Huh?

478
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,375
We're just friends.

479
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,250
Will you stop saying that?

480
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,583
It's like you're trying to jinx

481
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,583
any chance you have
of dating Eve.

482
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,041
A day ago,
you said I had no chance!

483
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,666
That was before
everyone saw you

484
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,083
leave school
with her yesterday.

485
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,958
Everyone saw that?

486
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,208
It doesn't matter.

487
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,309
She already has a boyfriend.

488
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,458
So?

489
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,250
You can be more awesome than him
and take his place.

490
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,000
That's how dating works!

491
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,458
Why are you
so intimidated by her?

492
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,541
Other than she's amazing
and you're kinda basic?

493
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,333
Thanks for that, William.

494
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,166
I gotta go.

495
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,375
Go?

496
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,041
Go where?

497
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,750
You know what, I don't care.

498
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:36,250
It's probably somewhere
you'll be alone forever.

499
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,750
Is Mark dating Eve Wilkins?

500
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,541
I wish!

501
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,208
I-I mean, no.

502
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,083
Definitely not.

503
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,041
She's got a boyfriend.

504
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,583
He is super available.

505
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,500
Want his number?

506
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,208
I'll write it down for you.

507
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,041
Uh, where are you guys
coming from?

508
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,500
Um, we go to the same
high-school, Rex.

509
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,791
Oh, you do, do you?

510
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,875
Um, yeah, we do.

511
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,583
Must be nice.

512
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,375
You know who never
got to go to high school?

513
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,333
Me.

514
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,833
We know.
It shows.

515
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,708
I'd appreciate
everyone's attention

516
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,750
on the matter at hand.

517
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,500
Guess who's back.

518
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,333
They're not getting old, Robot.

519
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,416
Why aren't they getting old?

520
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,559
They seem to have discovered

521
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,291
a way to resist
our time stream.

522
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,625
In three days?

523
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:35,708
Three days for us.

524
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,291
Decades for them.

525
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,125
Who cares?

526
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,375
I bet their bones still break.

527
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:42,041
So do ours!

528
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,083
Ready for this?

529
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:45,375
Yeah.

530
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,958
I think so.

531
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,458
Ah!

532
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,916
Orep udea!

533
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,833
Hey, don't do that!

534
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,791
Run!

535
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:50,916
Whew...

536
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:54,625
Y'ah!

537
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,750
Ah!

538
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,500
Ugh!

539
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,458
Xopa moy.

540
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:35,875
They seem...

541
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,208
to have spent
their time wisely.

542
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,875
Eve!

543
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,083
No, don't!

544
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,916
Don't. Don't! No!

545
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,791
I said, no!

546
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:54,875
Brax moy!

547
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,833
Invincible!

548
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,041
Eve!

549
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,666
You okay?

550
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,250
The wristbands protect them
from our timestream.

551
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,291
Destroy their wristbands.

552
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,583
What?

553
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,166
All of them?

554
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:50,791
Y'ah!

555
00:27:57,916 --> 00:27:59,375
Y'ah!

556
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:06,125
49,000 kilohertz.

557
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,715
Keep them off meeee...

558
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,416
♪ eeeeee... ♪

559
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,666
Right back 'atcha, buddy.

560
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,583
Way to go psycho there,
Invincible.

561
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,625
I take back everything
I said about you before,

562
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,083
and I said a lot.

563
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,583
I don't know what happened.

564
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,750
I got mad... I guess?

565
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,333
Don't get me wrong,
that was amazing,

566
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,708
but also the scariest thing
I've ever seen.

567
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,083
Just don't ever
point that at me, okay?

568
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,166
Don't listen to Rex.

569
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,208
You did great.

570
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,000
That's what I said, Eve.

571
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:57,000
God, my back.

572
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,708
Can I get a massage?

573
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,458
Anybody?
Just a little rub?

574
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Everything okay?

575
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,083
I gotta go.

576
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,625
Oh, no, that's fine.

577
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:06,875
We'll handle the clean-up.

578
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:08,708
Asshole!

579
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,583
Oh!

580
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:16,875
Mark!

581
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:19,125
- Hey, son.
- Dad!

582
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,291
Ow!

583
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,125
Ribs...

584
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,291
Careful!

585
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,375
You're going to put him
in a coma again.

586
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:25,541
You're okay!

587
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:27,166
No, he's not,

588
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,625
but he is okay enough
to come home.

589
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:32,958
Mom says you've been keeping
the planet safe for me.

590
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,958
Mom's exaggerating.

591
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,250
Tell me everything.

592
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,708
What hospital
did they move Maya to?

593
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:57,125
No, they said she'd recover.

594
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:59,375
It's part of the job.

595
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,791
Come on, let's go home.

596
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,458
I'm dying for some real food.

597
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,666
Hey, I need my costume back.

598
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,375
I don't care how torn up it is.

599
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:11,916
It's classified,

600
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,250
and I want it back.

601
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,166
Go get it.

602
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,333
Now.

603
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,500
Where are
the Guardians of the Globe?

604
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,708
There's been no sign
of the iconic heroes

605
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,958
for over a week,

606
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,750
leaving the local champions
to pick up the slack.

607
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:37,708
It's like
you're not even trying.

608
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,083
And now you're trying too hard.

609
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,583
Slow down.

610
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,833
Don't hit me where I am,

611
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,041
hit me where I'm going...

612
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,625
Thanks for the tip.

613
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:52,791
You know, you have to be able
to take a hit, too.

614
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:53,916
Nolan!

615
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,083
Oh, great.

616
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,833
We picked this up
near Mars an hour ago.

617
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,708
Moving fast.

618
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,833
He's back.

619
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,250
15 minutes
till he's breathing our air.

620
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,208
I wouldn't ask, Nolan,

621
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,958
but with the Guardians gone...

622
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,416
I'll stop him.

623
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:13,500
Who's he?

624
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:14,916
Nolan's been home a week,

625
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,666
and you want to send him
to space?

626
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,541
No. No way.

627
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:19,666
He doesn't work for you.

628
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:20,625
Sweetie...

629
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,250
There's no one else, Debbie.

630
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:23,083
I'll go.

631
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:24,750
- Sweetie...
- I said, no.

632
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:25,833
You're still injured.

633
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:26,666
I'll go.

634
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:27,833
Okay.

635
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,750
- What?
- Why not?

636
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:30,750
He's not that tough.
Mark can take him.

637
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:32,416
Oh, wonderful.

638
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,333
That's your solution?

639
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,958
Could you define
"not that tough"?

640
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,309
Just knock some sense
into the guy

641
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,601
and throw him
back where he came from.

642
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,625
Easy.

643
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,500
How do I breathe in space?

644
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:44,833
That's the neat thing.

645
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,875
You don't.

646
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:48,416
12 minutes.

647
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,250
Okay...

648
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:15,333
Hey, you're early!

649
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,333
And you shaved your mustache.

650
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:19,375
Stay away from my planet!

651
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,083
Not bad,

652
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,045
but if you're trying
to tackle me into something,

653
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,708
your moon is that way!

654
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,291
Why can I hear you in my head?

655
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,958
Where else
do you keep your brain?

656
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,333
That's what you call
protecting your planet?

657
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,375
I am sad for your people!

658
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,750
Are you sure you're the same guy
I fought here three years ago?

659
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,708
What? No, I'm not the same guy!

660
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,333
Well, sucks to be you then.

661
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,375
Ah, my eye!

662
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,791
Really?

663
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,291
- You tried this already.
- Huh?

664
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,791
Ha!

665
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,625
Maybe you'll do after all.

666
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:33,791
What are you talking about?

667
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:38,333
Wait! Stop! I...

668
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,916
Hold on, I just wanna...

669
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:40,958
I wanna talk!

670
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:43,875
Are you using your time out?

671
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:45,708
I get a time out?

672
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,875
Why do I get a time out?

673
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:48,791
Hey, I didn't invent the rules.

674
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,875
What rules?

675
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:52,791
I don't even know who you are!

676
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,875
Oh. You don't?

677
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:10,416
All right, um...

678
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:13,291
I'm an evaluation officer
for the Coalition of Planets.

679
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,625
I drop by little dirtballs
like yours

680
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:18,208
to make sure there's someone
capable of defending them

681
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,583
against, you know,
planet-conquering monsters,

682
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,333
things of that nature.

683
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:26,291
I literally have no idea
what any of that means.

684
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,642
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, man.

685
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,500
Your planet signed up
for the program.

686
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:30,500
See?

687
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:31,767
Request from Urath
for evaluation.

688
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:32,750
Urath!

689
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:34,083
This is Earth!

690
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,000
Earth?

691
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,083
Yes!

692
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:40,583
Not Urath?

693
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:41,666
No.

694
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,750
Is that with an "E"
or a "U"?

695
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,791
"E"!

696
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,541
Oh, I'm in so much trouble.

697
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:49,291
Well, thanks
for letting me know.

698
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,458
I'm Allen, by the way.

699
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,708
Invincible.

700
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,000
Oh, yeah?

701
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,500
A little optimistic, isn't it?

702
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:56,416
Yeah, I know.

703
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:57,416
I just fought you,

704
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:59,833
and I think
you're quite "vincible."

705
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,833
Okay, well, as long as
I don't get fired,

706
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,750
I'll see you around, Invincible.

707
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:05,833
Sorry about all the...

708
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,708
you know.

709
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,291
What the hell was that?

710
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,625
Wow.

711
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,083
Cool.

712
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,833
Before I go...

713
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:23,125
I already told you
everything I remember.

714
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:24,708
Right.

715
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,416
Right, just go over it
for me one more time.

716
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,083
I got a distress call
from the Guardians,

717
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:34,333
but when I arrived,
everything seemed fine.

718
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:37,041
Then the lights went out
and someone attacked me.

719
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,708
I fought with them
until I passed out.

720
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,166
Woke up in your hospital.

721
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,250
That's it.

722
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:43,708
That's it?

723
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,958
Hmm.

724
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,666
Must have been
a pretty tough bastard

725
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:47,791
to take you down.

726
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:51,791
I've never seen you lose
like that before.

727
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,750
Yeah.

728
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,333
Do you have any leads yet?

729
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:59,250
Someone thinks
they're too clever for us.

730
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:02,458
They all think that at first.

731
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,375
Oh, my God!

732
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,416
Ow!

733
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:14,291
Oh, great.

734
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:16,875
Excuse you.

735
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,625
Look, Todd.

736
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:19,833
Why don't we just...

737
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:20,916
Shut it, Grayson!

738
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,166
- I'm sorry.
- What?

739
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,500
I'm sorry I kicked your ass.

740
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,500
I don't know
what you're saying.

741
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,625
I'm sorry
I kicked your ass, okay?

742
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:35,958
Oh.

743
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,166
Thanks, I guess?

744
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,392
Amber Bennett
also wants to know

745
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:42,041
- if you'd like her number.
- What?

746
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,166
Do you want Amber's
phone number, nerd!

747
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,333
Yes, but why are you...

748
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,250
Because she found
some old photos of me, okay?

749
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,708
Photos she said she'd delete
if I did this one stupid thing,

750
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,851
and then never
talked to you again.

751
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,333
There.

752
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,625
Have a crappy life with her.

753
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:56,208
You both suck.

754
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:01,041
Photos of what, Todd?

755
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,333
Don't push your luck, Grayson.

756
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:08,208
Amber?

757
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,625
I-I mean, uh, hello?

758
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,500
Brax moy!

759
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:28,750
I have bad news.

760
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,333
Oh!

761
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,625
Robot's got bad news, everybody.

762
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:33,750
Did ya hear that?

763
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:36,583
Hey, Robot,
what's the bad news?

764
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:37,809
There are too many of them,

765
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,500
their technology
has advanced too far,

766
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:42,708
and they've rendered themselves
immune to our time stream.

767
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,500
We should consider
the city lost.

768
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:47,333
I will contact Cecil
and suggest a nuclear response.

769
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:48,625
What? No!

770
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,875
No way!

771
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:55,000
We're not nuking anyone, Robot,
and we're not giving up.

772
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:57,041
What are we, Fight Force?

773
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,041
I love you, man,

774
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:01,458
but sometimes,
you've got a screw loose.

775
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,083
I don't use screws.

776
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,458
My fastenings are all
magnetic interlocks.

777
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:27,291
Oh!

778
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:35,833
Invincible!

779
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:38,541
Ah!

780
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,791
Help.

781
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,208
Die.

782
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,500
Are you okay, Mark?

783
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:24,750
My turn.

784
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:25,958
H'ah!

785
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,833
H'ah!

786
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:52,416
Juti urec!

787
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:54,000
Laji moy!

788
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,541
Dad!

789
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:06,708
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

790
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,541
Omni-Man's your dad?

791
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,541
What happened?

792
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:25,166
Dad saved us from the Flaxans...

793
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:28,375
but he went into
one of their portals.

794
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,333
Oh.

795
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:30,541
So he'll be late for dinner?

796
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,125
I was worried before

797
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,750
because I've never seen
your father so badly hurt,

798
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:39,750
but taking on aliens
in another dimension?

799
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:41,250
That's just Tuesday.

800
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:47,041
I'm sure he's explaining nicely
why they should leave us alone.

801
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:51,916
You don't seem to understand.

802
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:55,583
Earth isn't yours to conquer.

803
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,541
I need a shower.

804
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:45,791
Dad!

805
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,708
I'm-I'm at a loss
for how to report this,

806
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:59,041
but the Guardians of the Globe
are dead.

807
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,916
Get an extraction team
out there now.

808
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,833
Tell the French President
we have it covered.

809
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:17,416
I need the room.

810
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:18,583
Now!

811
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,875
Well? Enlighten me.

812
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,000
Know one thing for sure.

813
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:28,458
No one else at scene of murders.

814
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,541
Only Guardians.

815
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,000
Omni-Man.

816
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:35,041
Which means killer must be
one of them.

817
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:36,375
One of them?

818
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:38,601
There's a hundred super-villains
who don't leave a trace.

819
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,500
Who turn into smoke,
or living electricity,

820
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:44,250
or only exist in dreams.

821
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:45,500
I know.

822
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:47,000
You don't listen to me.

823
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:48,083
You listen!

824
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:50,250
Now, you mention
your idiotic thoughts to anyone,

825
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:51,708
and I mean anybody,

826
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,726
I'll make sure they're
the last thoughts you ever have.

827
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,083
You understand me?

828
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:57,000
Now, get out.

829
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,541
Get out!

830
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:01,583
Before I send you
back to hell myself.

831
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:05,500
Blind old man.

832
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:09,208
Put an A-6 surveillance team
on the Graysons.

833
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,500
Sir?

834
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:12,791
The killer's
still out there, Donald.

835
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:15,291
Might decide
to finish the job.
