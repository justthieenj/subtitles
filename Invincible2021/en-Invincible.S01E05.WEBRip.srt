1
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,125
We wanted Nolan off planet

2
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,458
so we could investigate him
for the murders

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,916
without arousing his suspicion.

4
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,958
What does sending Mark away
get us?

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,083
A chance to see
what this kid can do.

6
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,083
More importantly,

7
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,500
if his heart's
in the right place.

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,208
Who the hell are you?

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,208
Where are you going?

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,791
You know, it's desert-y.

11
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:35,934
You don't know
where you're going.

12
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,125
Go, go, go, go, go!

13
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,666
Please don't lose
interest in me while I'm gone.

14
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,541
Hey, Cecil.
You missed a spot?

15
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,625
Left that one there
as a reminder,

16
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,875
and when you prove yourselves

17
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,041
worthy of the heroes
who came before you,

18
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,083
it will get cleaned off.

19
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:51,976
You murdered seven people.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,333
Wife already suspects.

21
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,708
Dominari...

22
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,708
You didn't listen to me

23
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,375
when I told you
to drop the goddamn case.

24
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,458
Nothing to worry about.

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,166
Everything's fine.

26
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,291

Ooh.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,958
Tell Mr. Liu,

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,625
next time I find him
on our turf,

50
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,333
I won't be so gentle.

51
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,416
That message was for you.

52
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,833
Don't be stupid, kid.

53
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,666
I'm cutting you a break...

54
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,958
Go.

55
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,291
Oh, shit...

56
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,166
This time, I'm ready!

57
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,416
I surrender...

58
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,666
I surrender...

59
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,875
Yo, roll that back.

60
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:12,916
I surrender...

61
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,416
Oh, this new guy's dope.

62
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,375
Hey.

63
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,208
Yes,
I'm 20 minutes late,

64
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,375
but there's no way
you're gonna be mad at me.

65
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,958
And how do you figure that?

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,458
Because I brought you
Japanese cheesecake.

67
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,291
You went
all the way across town

68
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,166
to get cheesecake...

69
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,041
Yup.

70
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,250
...to make up for being late,

71
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,208
because you went across town
to get cheesecake?

72
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,333
Is that crazy?

73
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,750
Yeah, it kind of is.

74
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,375
I mean, I could take it back,

75
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,083
but that'll probably just
make me even more late...

76
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,541
Hey!

77
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,875
What'd we ever
do to you?

78
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,416
Kevin, shut up.

79
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,416
Leave it alone.

80
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,791
There's a place
on Third and Parkland.

81
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,916
They'll put you up
for a few weeks.

82
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,958
You're welcome!

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,375
Just trying to keep
the city safe.

84
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,958
Behind you!

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What? Oh, crap.

86
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:49,625
Hi.

87
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't be scared.
I got this,

88
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,166
but, uh, I guess,
get your stuff?

89
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,458
Sorry about your apartment.

90
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,833
45 minutes late!

91
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,166
It won't happen again,
Mr. Sayer.

92
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,500
But it has, Grayson.

93
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,625
You've been late 12 times
in the past three months.

94
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,625
I'm sorry,

95
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,250
but I'm docking
your shifts.

96
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,791
You know what?

97
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,375
Don't bother.

98
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,375
I quit.

99
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,583
What!

100
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,166
Mr. Sayer? There's a rat
in the mayonnaise again.

101
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,250
Do I look like I care, Sam?

102
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,416
Grayson?

103
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,333
Grayson?

104
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,511
I'll have the cash
tomorrow, I swear!

105
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,250
Tell your boss
I need more time!

106
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,833
There isn't
any more time, Gary.

107
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,208
Take it all.

108
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,250
Take everything I got.

109
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,250
Oof!

110
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,250
Two days.

111
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:47,125
After that,
you're painting sidewalk.

112
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,833
Oh, God!

113
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,476
The Gravity Bomb, where is it?

114
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,875
I'll never tell!

115
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,333
Now what?

116
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,458
Mark, you have to scare him.

117
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,750
Make him think
you'll actually drop him.

118
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,125
I can hear you!

119
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,833
I don't know,
that seems mean.

120
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,166
All right here,
I'll show you.

121
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,125
- Whoa!
- There, see?

122
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,708
Now he'll tell me
everything.

123
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,541
Okay, but you're
gonna catch him, right?

124
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,625
Yeah.

125
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,958
In a second.

126
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,041
Crap.

127
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,958
Uh, Principal Winslow.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,166
Uh... hi.

129
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,416
Mr. Grayson.

130
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,500
If you're planning
to attend college,

131
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,333
we need to have
a conversation

132
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,375
about your recent...

133
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,625
attendance issues.

134
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:48,791
Uh, what if I'm not planning
to attend college?

135
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,291
Freeze!

136
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,833
Your lives worth
minimum wage?

137
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,434
Or do you wanna fire
your guns in the air,

138
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,583
say you tried your best,

139
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,250
and we all walk away happy,

140
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,583
and alive?

141
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,291
"Hey, can't make it tonight.

142
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,541
Just got hit by something."

143
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,333
"You're standing me up?

144
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,291
You tread on dangerous ground,
my friend."

145
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,476
"It'll be worth the wait

146
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,333
to see me
on my best behavior."

147
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,726
"Do not miss dinner

148
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,166
with my mom on Thursday

149
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,791
if you value everything
you hold dear, Mark Grayson."

150
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:54,416
"Not for the end of the world."

151
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,000
Seriously?

152
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,166
Not even scratched?

153
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,208
Not bad for a guy

154
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,250
with gravel
for fingers.

155
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,958
Oh... yeah.
Oh, yeah.

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,625
Yeah, that's...
that's nice.

157
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,916
That works nicely.

158
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:35,875
That's the last of it.

159
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,083
Paid in full.
I'm done.

160
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,541
Mm... nah.

161
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,375
Nah?

162
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,583
See, Titan,

163
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,500
your problem
is you're too useful.

164
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,083
You get shit done.

165
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,166
You take bullets like a champ,

166
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,583
and don't even whine about it,

167
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,583
unlike someone else
in the room.

168
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,916
It was
one fucking time.

169
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,791
- I said...
- Shut the hell up!

170
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,226
Yeah, yeah, sometimes,
you let people live

171
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,666
when they need to die,

172
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,208
but, man, you make an impact.

173
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,958
If you didn't just finish
paying off your debt,

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,958
we'd be talking bonus time.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,583
I don't need
your money anymore.

176
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,833
Sure, you do.

177
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,416
Come on, like
you're gonna go clean?

178
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,833
Work the fry-station
at Burger-Mart?

179
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,208
That ship
has sailed, amigo.

180
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,000
This is your life now.

181
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,833
This is what you do.

182
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,791
No, it's not.

183
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,708
You're a walking
pile of rocks.

184
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,375
You break heads.

185
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,333
That's it.

186
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,291
That's all.

187
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,791
Own it already.

188
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,500
See, I know you're gonna
keep working for me.

189
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,500
The question is,

190
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,625
how painful do you
want it to be?

191
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,625
What are you doing?

192
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,541
You think you can just
punch your way out of this?

193
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,708
I know where
your family lives,

194
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,333
and that means
you work for me

195
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,125
until I say
you're fucking done!

196
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,208
Yeah, see?

197
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,083
See!

198
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,708
Impressive shit
like that

199
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,083
is exactly why

200
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,041
I'm never
letting you go!

201
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,916
Plus, now you gotta
pay for the desk, too.

202
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,333
This was imported
Italian maple.

203
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,625
Now just
throw it back into space.

204
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,625
How does it feel
to save the world?

205
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,916
Or at least the country?

206
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,833
By the way,
that was a small one.

207
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,083
That was a small one?

208
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,559
Yeah, you should've
seen the asteroid

209
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,166
I diverted a few years ago.

210
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,333
The size of Texas.

211
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,291
Aw, crap.

212
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,375
I gotta run, Dad.

213
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,125
Hey, whatever that is,

214
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,333
your training
is more important.

215
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,500
Big picture, right?

216
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,583
I know, but it's Amber.

217
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,000
Mark, we talked about this.

218
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,083
Dad...

219
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,666
This one time, okay?

220
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,291
Yes!

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,250
I know I'm a little late...

222
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,958
I brought dessert.

223
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,208
Ugh.

224
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,333
Okay, that's fair.

225
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,958
You were right.

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,333
Your mom's
a great cook.

227
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,166
You should've
told her that yourself.

228
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,291
During dinner.

229
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,291
Two hours ago.

230
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,250
I tried to text you...

231
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,875
Am I important
to you, Mark?

232
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:46,916
Uh... yeah.

233
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:47,916
Of course.

234
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,041
Well, it really
doesn't feel like it.

235
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,541
Half the time
we make plans,

236
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,500
you're late,

237
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,541
or you cancel,

238
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,416
or you just don't show,

239
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,291
and your excuses suck.

240
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,291
Hold on...

241
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,416
But then you pick up
the sushi I like,

242
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,750
or you leave a note
in my locker,

243
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,583
or you surprise me after class,

244
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,666
and you're not a bad kisser,

245
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,958
but that doesn't make it okay
if you keep doing it,

246
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,041
and tonight was just definitely
not okay.

247
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,125
This was three months.

248
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,958
This was meeting my mom.

249
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,958
It's just...

250
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,875
I have these
family responsibilities.

251
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,458
I help my dad with work.

252
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,125
It's hard making it all fit.

253
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,875
Sure. That's fine.

254
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,375
Then make that choice,

255
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,333
but then this?

256
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,208
I'm not doing this anymore.

257
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,916
I've been down
this road before,

258
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:33,916
and once was enough.

259
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:34,791
Hold on...

260
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:35,833
Why?

261
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,916
Because...

262
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm, uh...

263
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,666
You're what?

264
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,625
I'm...

265
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,833
I'm gonna do better.

266
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,541
I promise.

267
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,583
Prove it.

268
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:02,750
Hey, Dad.

269
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,041
Mark,

270
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,726
I'm watching the Elephant
rob a store downtown.

271
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,708
He'd be perfect practice
for you.

272
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,208
I'm not really in the mood...

273
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,250
Mark...

274
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,083
Okay. I'm coming.

275
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,833
That's my boy.

276
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,833
Did somebody ask
for butterscotch ripple?

277
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,250
Daddy!

278
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,375
Mommy, he got my text!

279
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,375
Good.

280
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,333
Means we still have service.

281
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,875
We're not out, are we?

282
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:07,976
Nessa, it's not that simple.

283
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,375
Don't.

284
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,208
Get the fuck out of here!

285
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,291
Get your stupid...

286
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,291
I wanna sit with you.

287
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,291
Wait, baby.
Let me help.

288
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,041
Daddy look,
a superhero!

289
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,541
Is he a good guy?

290
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,833
That's what people say.

291
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,125
Are you a good guy?

292
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,875
I...

293
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,625
What's his name?

294
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,125
Him?

295
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,416
He calls himself...

296
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,000
Brr...

297
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,625
Seven dead.

298
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,791
One Alive.

299
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,750
Your husband.

300
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:19,791
Hey, Debbie...

301
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,916
Jesus!

302
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,041
What was the name
of that place in Bordeaux?

303
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,333
The one with the chocolate
pastry thingies?

304
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,583
Uh, the...

305
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,250
Éclair d'André?

306
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,125
That's it!

307
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,916
Thanks, sweetie.

308
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,916
Hey, I need
my costume back.

309
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,708
I don't care
how torn up it is.

310
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,166
It's classified,

311
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,666
and I want it back.

312
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,708
Go get it.

313
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,041
Now.

314
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,750
I don't need to tell you
when I break up with someone.

315
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,416
The only, and I mean
only reason

316
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,916
I agreed to you
being a superhero

317
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,666
was because Rex was there
to take care of you.

318
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,500
I can take care
of myself.

319
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,041
Your father only means

320
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,791
that we liked Rex
very much,

321
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,500
and we felt good
that he was keeping you safe.

322
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,833
But now that you're not even
part of a team...

323
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,708
Rex cheated on me!

324
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,375
Teen Team broke up.

325
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,166
They're both over.
It happens.

326
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,666
- Forgive him.
- What?

327
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,666
All guys make mistakes!

328
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,083
Don't be a...

329
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,166
You're an 18-year-old girl.

330
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,416
You can't do
this hero bullshit on your own.

331
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,125
You shouldn't be
doing it at all.

332
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,250
One, I can do anything
I want on my own.

333
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,434
Literally!

334
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,541
I can rearrange atoms
on a molecular level

335
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,666
like it's easy,

336
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,916
and two,
I'm not even sure

337
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,583
I want to do this anymore!

338
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,541
Good!

339
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,916
It's about time.

340
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,041
That includes
this stupid family!

341
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,291
Samantha!

342
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,500
Don't you leave
that door there!

343
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,000
Whoo-hoo!

344
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,458
Huh?

345
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,416
♪ Been sailing seas
of the spoiled and the rotten ♪

346
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,458
♪ Been throwing over board
the once forgotten ♪

347
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,666
♪ Things you never think about
when thinking's such a bore ♪

348
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,166
Huh?

349
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,291
You missed a few letters.

350
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,291
Paint costs money
and you got a long-ass name.

351
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,875
Oh, you're that guy I stopped
from robbing a bank

352
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,625
a few months ago.

353
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,708
My name's Titan.

354
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,041
Oh... you're...

355
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,500
you're out for revenge.

356
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,041
Fine, let's do this.

357
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,041
I didn't call you
here to fight.

358
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:09,958
Because I'd win?

359
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,041
You got lucky.

360
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,625
Sure, I did.

361
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,166
I called you here
because I need your help.

362
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,708
Why would I help you?

363
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,833
You're a criminal.

364
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,833
You don't even know
what that word means.

365
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,416
Uh, pretty sure I do.

366
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,416
No, you don't.

367
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,583
I'm not a criminal,

368
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,708
I just owed one money,

369
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,791
and now
I can't get out.

370
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,625
So?

371
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,625
So aren't you a hero?

372
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,583
Helping people

373
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,750
and taking down
bad guys?

374
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:32,750
Yeah...

375
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,000
So help me take down my boss.

376
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,351
They don't get
any worse than him.

377
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,833
Who's your boss?

378
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,958
Machine Head.

379
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,291
That's not a real name.

380
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,333
Huh.

381
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,875
Of course, you haven't
heard of him.

382
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,833
You're a rich kid
from the suburbs.

383
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,125
What? No, I'm...

384
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,125
You don't know!

385
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,625
Come on, man.

386
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,708
Machine Head runs this city.

387
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,291
If it's illegal
and it makes money,

388
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,541
it's his,

389
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,184
and when people need to die
to keep it that way,

390
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,375
he's got muscle like me
to take care of it.

391
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,375
Yeah, I'm more like
a big picture superhero.

392
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,208
Saving the planet,
stuff like that.

393
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,375
Why don't you give, uh,
Fight Force a call?

394
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,125
Sure, man,
just fly away.

395
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,541
Forget about
everyone else down here.

396
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,541
Let me show you

397
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,750
what you don't see
from up there.

398
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,791
What, like, right now?

399
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,208
You got somewhere to be?

400
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,416
This is some bullshit.

401
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,750
It's not a party
for me either, man.

402
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,083
Machine Head
owns the trash company,

403
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,708
uses it to ferry drugs
to stash houses

404
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,208
all over the city.

405
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,125
Machine Head owns
this whole block.

406
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,875
He pays off inspectors
so he doesn't have to fix shit,

407
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,250
then burns them
for insurance money.

408
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,916
If anyone's inside
at the time,

409
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:48,958
too bad.

410
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,041
Which one's
Machine Head?

411
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,958
Kidding.
I'm kidding.

412
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,125
Isotope, let's go.

413
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,708
What the hell was that?

414
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,625
His pet.

415
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,041
You help me take down
Machine Head,

416
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,791
you help real people
with real lives.

417
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,000
Think about that

418
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,142
next time you're fighting
some stupid elephant-man

419
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,875
or whatever.

420
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,809
Why did you borrow money
from Machine Head anyway?

421
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,208
It wasn't for me.

422
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,041
Daddy!

423
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,458
I know I can take
Machine Head.

424
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,666
He's just a criminal
with a... special head,

425
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,958
but he does have
this right-hand man...

426
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,750
uh, Iso...

427
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,291
Isotope or something,
I don't know...

428
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,083
who can teleport him away
if I'm not careful.

429
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,166
Mom, can you pass
the potatoes, please?

430
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,000
Mom?

431
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,750
Sorry.

432
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,708
I dunno.

433
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,550
Do you think I should
help this Titan guy out?

434
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,416
You'd be making
a huge mistake.

435
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,875
What? Why?

436
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,333
Because he's using you.

437
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,833
I'm not an idiot, Dad.

438
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,166
I know when someone's lying.

439
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,000
Titan never wanted to be
a criminal in the first place.

440
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:17,916
He has a family.

441
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,375
I think his daughter's sick.

442
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,583
Even if that was true,

443
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,791
you're a Viltrumite, okay?

444
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,583
You fought off
an alien invasion,

445
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,541
saved the country
from an asteroid.

446
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,250
This is beneath you.

447
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,750
Mom?

448
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:32,666
I know that sometimes

449
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,208
people aren't
who they appear to be.

450
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,041
Exactly.

451
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,375
Listen to your mother.

452
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,458
You help this guy,

453
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,250
you're gonna learn
a very painful lesson.

454
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,833
But I also know

455
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,250
that helping someone
is never beneath you.

456
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,333
I'm gonna sleep on this.

457
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,833

the Lizard League turns people

462

was in that spot, though.

after you've crawled through
someone's inner ear...

482
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,666
Dude! What the hell?

483
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,250
Two dozen civilians

484
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,041
are in the hospital
right now

485
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,583
because we fought like
six individual assholes

486
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,041
instead of a team.

487
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,083
Pull up the fight.

488
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:01,958
You see this, Rex?

489
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,916
This right here?

490
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,416
I know what a bus looks like.

491
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,750
This is where you messed up,

492
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,166
you and Monster Girl.

493
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,166
Both so caught up
in your own little prize fights

494
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,791
that you let this entire bus
of civilians crash.

495
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:17,875
It had kids on it, man.

496
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,208
What were we
supposed to do?

497
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,666
You pop the tires on the bus,

498
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:23,041
blow that concrete to gravel
to slow it down,

499
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,708
so Monster Girl can stop it
and save lives!

500
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,666
That is what
you were supposed to do!

501
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,250
Dupli-Kate,

502
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,750
next time
we're in this situation,

503
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:35,017
I want you to think
about containment.

504
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,416
If you had cloned the perimeter
around King Lizard here,

505
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:38,583
you could've held him back

506
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,351
while Shrinking Rae
took care of his snake gun,

507
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,750
or whatever the hell
he called it.

508
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:43,125
"Snake-erator."

509
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,666
He called it
his snake-erator.

510
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,750
No!

511
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:47,750
Forget this.

512
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,625
We did our best,
and we won.

513
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,458
So whatever.

514
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,916
You don't even
have powers, old man.

515
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,166
Say that
one more time, son.

516
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:56,125
Why?

517
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,708
Forget your hearing aid,
Grandpa?

518
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,625
Okay, okay.

519
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:59,916
Stop.

520
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,500
He's not wrong, Rex.

521
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,041
Fuck this!

522
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,916
Good debrief, everyone.

523
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,541
As usual,
I'll be the only person

524
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,291
who actually sacrificed
something,

525
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,458
since I'm now
a week younger

526
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,333
than I was yesterday.

527
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,250
Can you believe these punks?

528
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,416
Some of them.

529
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,958
Why would you tell Mark

530
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,083
that saving lives
is beneath him?

531
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,500
Other people save lives.

532
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:26,916
Mark saves millions.

533
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,500
He needs to think big,
and you're not helping.

534
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,291
I'm not helping?

535
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,184
You don't understand
the choices we have to make.

536
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,208
You're not a superhero.

537
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,375
When you first came here,

538
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:37,458
you didn't know anything,

539
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,416
about humans,

540
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,541
or our society,

541
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:40,791
or what was important to us.

542
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:41,791
And?

543
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,125
I taught you all that.

544
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,458
I showed you
how to be a hero, here,

545
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,041
and, suddenly, you think
I can't do that for Mark?

546
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,000
That's not what I meant.

547
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,291
I just...

548
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,291
I think Mark
is putting his trust

549
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,458
in someone he shouldn't,

550
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,208
instead of listening to me...

551
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,291
to us,

552
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,041
even when we disagree.

553
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,000
He's only been a hero
for a few months.

554
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,875
He thinks he knows
everything.

555
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,291
I just don't want him

556
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,250
to make a choice
he'll regret.

557
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,541
Neither do I.

558
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,666
This is all going
so quickly.

559
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,375
I didn't think
it'd be this difficult.

560
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,666
Well, that sucked.

561
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,791
This superhero thing
is destroying my GPA.

562
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:28,041
Like you'll ever need
to find Mongolia on a map.

563
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:28,916
I know, right?

564
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:30,708
No, you do need
to know that.

565
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,791
I'm not kidding,

566
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,041
it's really important

567
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,250
that you can find places
from the air.

568
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,916
Oh, yeah.
Right.

569
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,208
You okay, Eve?

570
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,916
You look... down.

571
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,101
You ever read about
those kids

572
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,041
who get kicked out
of the house at 16,

573
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,625
and wish it was you?

574
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:47,666
Uh... no.

575
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,416
Not really.

576
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,083
Do you want to talk about it?

577
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,708
Yes. No.
I don't know.

578
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,833
I-I just don't know
what I'm doing anymore.

579
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,083
Mark!

580
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,500
Hey, you.

581
00:26:58,541 --> 00:26:59,750
Slow down, tiger,

582
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,416
you're still
on my shit list.

583
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,125
You're coming
tonight, right?

584
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:05,125
Hey, Eve.

585
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,708
Of course, I'm coming.

586
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,583
Do not stand me up
on this, okay?

587
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,291
It won't only be me
counting on you this time.

588
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,750
Mark volunteered
to help me

589
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,833
at the Beckwell
Community Center downtown.

590
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:17,166
We do dinners twice a week
for anyone who's hungry.

591
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,083
I'm impressed.

592
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,250
Do not be.

593
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:20,166
He owes me.

594
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:22,083
Beckwell's like
my second home.

595
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,351
I used to hang there
after school

596
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,791
till my mom
was done working.

597
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:25,708
Changed my life.

598
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,500
It's on Third Street, right?

599
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:28,416
Low brick building?

600
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,125
Yeah. 7:00 p.m.

601
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,000
Oh, man, gotta run.

602
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,208
I told my mom I'd help
with an open house.

603
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,041
I'll see you there.

604
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,000
Bye, Eve!

605
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,416
You wanna come tonight?

606
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,083
We could use the help.

607
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,541
Mm. I wish I could, but...

608
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,500
Too busy saving the world?

609
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:44,916
Hmm.

610
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,416
Not anymore, actually.

611
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,041
No excuse then.

612
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,625
You and Mark
are pretty close.

613
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,500
Has he been acting
weird lately?

614
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:54,500
What do you mean?

615
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:55,375
He's late,

616
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:56,416
all the time,

617
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,666
or doesn't show,
and then lies about why.

618
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:00,083
At least I think he's lying.

619
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,083
I don't know if I can
deal with it much longer.

620
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,416
Guys are dicks...

621
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,750
but Mark's one
of the good ones.

622
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:08,833
Yeah, his time management
is awful,

623
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,750
but he's super into you.

624
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,000
You're all he talks about.

625
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,958
Really? Hmm.

626
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,625
Well, thanks for that.

627
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:16,750
See you tonight?

628
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,666
Yeah.

629
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:20,041
The only place

630
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,791
we're guaranteed
to find Machine Head

631
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,000
is 60 stories up.

632
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,166
The room is lined with windows,

633
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,767
but they're bomb-proofed
with something.

634
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:30,166
There's a whole team
of ex-military assholes

635
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,291
patrolling the place,

636
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,916
packing the latest shit, too.

637
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,833
Which is why you need me, hmm?

638
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:36,833
I'm tough,

639
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,166
but I'm not stupid.

640
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,708
Can't the teleporter guy

641
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,041
just pull
Machine Head out

642
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,375
once we get close?

643
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,625
I took care of Isotope.

644
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:44,750
How?

645
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,833
He's got a girl he sees
a couple of times a week.

646
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,041
I paid her extra

647
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,750
to keep him there
all evening.

648
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:50,916
What?

649
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,083
Oh... okay.

650
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,750
So we break
into the penthouse

651
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:55,958
and grab Machine Head.

652
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,833
Then what?

653
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:57,916
Don't you got friends

654
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,184
who can keep a guy
like him off the street?

655
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,166
I could take him

656
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,208
to the Global Defense Agency.

657
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,166
See?

658
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,416
Doin' good already, hero.

659
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,208
That was your daughter,

660
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,208
back at Beckwell
Community Center, right?

661
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,250
What's her name?

662
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,250
Fiona.

663
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,083
You guys go there often?

664
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:19,166
It's her second home.

665
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,416
Okay, I'm in,

666
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,375
but we have to make it quick.

667
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,583
I've got plans later tonight.

668
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:39,625
Huh?

669
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:50,583
I almost forgot
how good I look.

670
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:26,000
Welcome to the world
of the living, clone.

671
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,291
Don't start.

672
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:30,541
I'm the original.

673
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,625
So the process
was a success.

674
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,466
I'll never understand
why you do that.

675
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:47,500
Stop, please.
I'm not here to fight.

676
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,916
Not the replication
chamber, idiot!

677
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,083
As I was trying to say,

678
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,250
I need your expertise
in tissue growth

679
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,833
and DNA replication.

680
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,416
I'll make it
worth your while.

681
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,125
Hi, honey.

682
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,208
If you have a sec,

683
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,041
could you pick up
a few things for dinner?

684
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,625
Well, I was thinking
some tagliatelle

685
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,083
from that restaurant in Rome,

686
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,416
and maybe that wine
from Provence,

687
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,125
the rosé.

688
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,166
Yeah.

689
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,166
Thanks, sweetie.
Love you.

690
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,333
What am I doing?

691
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:26,208
What the...?

692
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,541
Machine Head!

693
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,000
Get up.

694
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,208
We're taking you in.

695
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:39,791
Hey!

696
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,708
It's over.

697
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,750
You're way
out of your league.

698
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:44,916
Carry the two...

699
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:45,750
Oh, hello, Invincible.

700
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:46,625
Titan.

701
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:47,958
Boss.

702
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,125
You're right.

703
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,958
You're so strong,
and tough,

704
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,083
and you...

705
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,416
you, you fly all over
the goddamn place.

706
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:55,375
It's amazing.

707
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,458
Uh... thanks?

708
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,875
You know a lot about me.

709
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:00,291
I also knew
exactly when

710
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,958
you and this giant
pile of shit

711
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,458
would walk in here
and ruin my doors.

712
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,541
Also, Italian maple,
by the way!

713
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,642
No way you saw
this coming...

714
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,291
Aw, is that
what you think?

715
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,166
See, this is what happens
when your head's a fuckin' rock.

716
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,750
You said you took
care of him.

717
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:15,791
I know what I said.

718
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,500
This little upgrade

719
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,833
shows me all kinds
of possibilities,

720
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:20,958
which is how I know

721
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,166
it's not worth
explaining to you two morons

722
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:25,625
what quantum probabilities are,

723
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:26,916
but it doesn't matter,

724
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:29,208
because, like I said,
Invincible's right,

725
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,375
I'm out of my league.

726
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,875
Except...

727
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:35,541
I've got money!

728
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,458
Oh, shit.

729
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:47,708
You have no idea, kid.

730
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:50,458
Amber?

731
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,541
Hey! Eve!

732
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:52,583
You made it.

733
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:55,625
Come on,
I'll show you around.

734
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:56,875
Chicken.

735
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,500
Mashed potatoes.

736
00:33:58,541 --> 00:33:59,791
Salad.

737
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,541
Minestrone on the stove,

738
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,125
but we'll need another pot soon.

739
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,458
It's nothing fancy,
but it's healthy.

740
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,791
Hey, my parents cook

741
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,625
exclusively with a microwave.

742
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:10,125
This looks like a dream.

743
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,250
Mark here yet?

744
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:13,041
That boy's got
about 15 minutes

745
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,541
until his ass
is on the curb,

746
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,208
permanently.

747
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,010
You look like you're good
at chopping things.

748
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,500
How'd you know?

749
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,041
Ah!

750
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:52,541
Oof!

751
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,583
I'm gonna grind you up

752
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:01,416
and use you
to pave my driveway.

753
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,208
No!

754
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,708
You guys are fucking dead!

755
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,833
Who's next?

756
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:34,416
Hello, boy.

757
00:35:58,875 --> 00:35:59,708
Wow!

758
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,833
Ten out of ten!

759
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,791
You guys, you guys
are worth every cent...

760
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,125
Wait.

761
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,434
Wait, I'm getting
something here.

762
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,458
What?

763
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,291
Cecil got an anonymous call.

764
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:15,750
We'll take it
from here.

765
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,208
Murder!

766
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,041
These!

767
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,125
Assholes!

768
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,291
Dupli-Kate,

769
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,708
Monster Girl
is in trouble.

770
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,583
Huh?

771
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,583
I was promised

772
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,333
this world offered
worthy opponents!

773
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:58,250
But, oh,
how you disappoint.

774
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:02,833
Killing you
is an act of mercy.

775
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,833
Hey, asshole!

776
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,458
Invincible!

777
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,166
Black Samson, retreat!

778
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:59,333
Pathetic child.

780
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,166
No!

781
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,500
You guys just messed up.

782
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:40,958
Indeed.

783
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,625
Big time.

784
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,958
Pathetic.

785
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,458
This battle is beneath me.

786
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:49,833
There is no honor
in killing insects.

787
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:54,041
No...

788
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,708
No, no, no.

789
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,125
This was
an unexpected possibility.

790
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:00,208
Isotope, let's go.

791
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,041
Isotope!

792
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:10,166
Sorry, kid.

793
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:12,416
Didn't mean for it
to end this way,

794
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,000
but I gotta take care of mine.

795
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:17,500
I hope you make it.

796
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:21,208
The veggies are nice
and soft tonight, Rose.

797
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,208
I made sure of it.

798
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,041
Aw, thanks, Amber.

799
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:26,083
Kurt, you want to find me
in the kitchen later?

800
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,684
I've got that book
we were talking about.

801
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,750
That be great, thanks.

802
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:30,833
What?

803
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:33,541
I can barely remember
my English class,

804
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,666
and you know
everyone here by name.

805
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:38,166
Make the world
you wanna live in, right?

806
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:39,750
Right.

807
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,583
I thought Mark
would be here tonight.

808
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,583
I really did.

809
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:46,583
He's losing too much blood.

810
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,684
Get pressure on that wound.

811
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,750
Quick! Check his pupils.

812
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,583
She's fibrillating.
Step back.

813
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,875
Jesus fucking Christ.

814
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,166
Are we gonna lose him?

815
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:00,291
It's a possibility, sir.

816
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,000
No. We need him.

817
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:03,458
Do whatever it takes.

818
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,916
Get a sample to the lab,

819
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:07,166
just in case.

820
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:12,166
Huh?

821
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:22,375
He's losing
way too much blood.

822
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,958
...Dad?

823
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:28,250
We're losing him!

824
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:37,125
I gotta take this.

825
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,375
Amber, I'm sorry.

826
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,625
I... I have to go.

827
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,333
What's wrong?

828
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:51,875
Was that Mark?

829
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:57,500
It's okay, I'm here.

830
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,875
I'll fix you.

831
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,333
I know it's hard
to love someone

832
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,041
when they don't seem
to love you back,

833
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,833
but Mark loves you.

834
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:16,583
He'd be here if he could.

835
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:37,208
Wow...

836
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:39,976
I gotta hand it to you, boss.

837
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,517
Whatever you told that kid
to get him on your side,

838
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:42,333
it fuckin'...

839
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:43,583
I told him the truth.

840
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,226
I'm gonna make this city better
for a lot of people...

841
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,666
...but some people
come first.

842
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:51,333
Daddy!

843
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,375
Mm...

844
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,333
Is this our new house?

845
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:02,250
♪ Make way for the king... ♪

846
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,333
♪ Make way for the kingdom ♪

847
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:16,750
♪ King me, checkmate... ♪

848
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:17,892
♪ This chess, not checkers ♪

849
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:19,541
♪ What can I say... ♪

850
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:44,416
Any progress?

851
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,458
Jesus, that bad?

852
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,000
We've tried everything.

853
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,708
Drugs, viruses,

854
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,791
bacteria, prions,

855
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:55,458
even nanobots and radioactives.

856
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,583
Viltrumite cells
don't give a damn.

857
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,458
They just won't die.

858
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,291
Well, keep trying.

859
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,583
I got a feeling
blood's still the answer.
