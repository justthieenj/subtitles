1
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,458
Get out of my house!

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,708
We'll talk later.

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,750
Where's Mark, Debbie?

4
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,309
I know you're a superhero.

5
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,666
Fly away, flyboy.

6
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:25,916
Hey, Eve.

7
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,416
So I'm helping you today.

8
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,416
We've been
growing you a new body.

9
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,375
Does Mark know
that his dad's a murderer?

10
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,875
Keep out of this, Cecil.

11
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:35,916
It's Mark's mom.

12
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,125
I need to talk to him.

13
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,541
What's going on?

14
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,583
Where's Omni-Man?

15
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,583
Where is he?

16
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,625
Murderer!

17
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,833
You've betrayed us!

18
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,333
You should have stayed dead.

19
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:50,708
Dad?

20
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,125
Mark.

21
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,708
We need to talk.

22
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,666
No!

23
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,666
Someone's controlling you!

24
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:25,666
Dad!

25
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:26,958
Dad! Tell me how to stop them!

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,833
Mark...

27
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,000
Let my dad go!

28
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,375
Let him...
let him go.

29
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,416
Stop.

30
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:36,958
It's me, Mark.

31
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:39,291
It's just me.

32
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,750
This isn't how
I wanted to do this,

33
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:48,875
but I don't have a choice.

34
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,416
It's time for you to know
where I really come from.

35
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,208
I am from Viltrum,

36
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,666
but it's not the planet
I've told you about.

37
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,500
We have created
a perfect civilization,

38
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,458
but it took all of our strength,

39
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,583
determination,

40
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:04,583
and courage to get there.

41
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,708
In order for our people
to reach their full potential,

42
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,125
we had to remove the weak
from our society.

43
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,625
It was a long
and difficult process.

44
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,958
When it was over,
our population was cut in half,

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but what emerged from the ashes
was unstoppable.

46
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,541
By the time I was born,

47
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,791
Viltrum was already

48
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,833
the greatest empire
in our galaxy.

49
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,500
We decided to make it
the only empire in our galaxy.

50
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,458
Once I was old enough,
I joined the war effort.

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,625
It was hard,
but I believe in our cause.

52
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,583
Some species resisted,
of course,

53
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,625
but no one could withstand us
for long.

54
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,666
Soon, our empire encompassed
thousands of planets.

55
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,875
But as our territory grew,

56
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,208
our forces were stretched thin
and our expansion stopped.

57
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,458
We needed a better,

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,958
more efficient way
to conquer worlds.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,708
Our most trusted officers
were each given a planet

60
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,833
to weaken by themselves.

61
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,541
I was one of those lucky few.

62
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,458
I couldn't tell your mother
why I was here...

63
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,000
But that time's
come to an end...

64
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,708
And now we need
to get Earth ready

65
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,458
to join the Viltrum Empire.

66
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,375
Mark, this is good news.

67
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,291
We can finally do
what we were meant to do.

68
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,833
Be who we were meant to be.

69
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,666
You lied to me.

70
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,791
You couldn't know the truth...

71
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,833
Not until you had your powers.

72
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,125
Not until I was sure.

73
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,125
Sure of what?

74
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,833
Sure you were a Viltrumite.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,958
So if I wasn't,

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,666
I'd just be
one more human to conquer?

77
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,708
No. This doesn't make any sense.

78
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,291
You love me.

79
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,291
You love Mom.

80
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,708
I know you do.

81
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,250
Do you have any idea
how long we live?

82
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,041
The older we get,
the slower we age.

83
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,875
Viltrumite DNA is so pure
you're nearly full-blooded.

84
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:19,000
You'll live
for thousands of years.

85
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,375
Do you understand
what that means?

86
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,583
Everyone you know and love
will be gone

87
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,083
before you even look 30.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,291
It's not something
I want for you.

89
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,625
This isn't your world.

90
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,041
It's theirs.

91
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,541
But we can help them.

92
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,166
We can stop wars.

93
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,500
Eliminate hunger.

94
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,791
Give them medical technology

95
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,625
centuries ahead
of what they have now.

96
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,000
We've already been doing it.

97
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:52,000
If it wasn't for you and me,
this planet would be in flames.

98
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,208
All we have to do

99
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,000
is welcome Earth
into our empire.

100
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,041
I do love your mother.

101
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,000
But she's more like a...

102
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,000
a pet to me.

103
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,000
A pet?

104
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,583
This is the only way, Mark.

105
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,708
Don't touch me!

106
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,708
Calm down.

107
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,750
I will not calm down!

108
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,375
This is insane!

109
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,208
What do you think
is gonna happen?

110
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,000
That I'm gonna go enslave
my friends

111
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,958
for a bunch of aliens
I've never met?

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,333
This is my life!

113
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,791
These are my people!

114
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,208
We have a responsibility
to Viltrum...

115
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,434
I don't give a shit
about Viltrum.

116
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,434
And I don't care if I live
a fuckin' million years.

117
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,958
This is my home
and I won't let you destroy it!

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,791
You don't know
what you're saying.

119
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,625
And I can't let you interfere.

120
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,416
I know exactly what I'm saying.

121
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
So be it.

122
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,458
Do you really think
you can stop me?

123
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,083
Agh!

124
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,583
Map their trajectory.

125
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,851
I need to know
where they're going

126
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,000
before they get there.

127
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,892
Debbie, I'm so sorry
you had to listen to that.

128
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,583
They're going
to kill each other, Cecil!

129
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,625
You have to stop this.

130
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,726
We have them, sir.

131
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,708
They're slowing down

132
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,541
about 20 miles
southeast of Chicago.

133
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,541
Chicago?

134
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,041
They're in range.
Scramble our jets.

135
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,791
Sir? What could they do?

136
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,434
After everything else
we've thrown at Nolan?

137
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,583
Not much.

138
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,809
But at least
they're a distraction.

139
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,916
Maybe it'll give the kid

140
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,291
a chance
to think of something.

141
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,541
Holy fuck...

142
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,750
Okay, what do we do?

143
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,958
Do we go out there?

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,916
And do what?

145
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,101
We couldn't even
keep up with them.

146
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,083
No.

147
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,500
We follow Cecil's orders
and remain here.

148
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,666
This battle is beyond
our current capabilities.

149
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,791
Robot is...

150
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,000
Rudy's right.

151
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,059
We'll get our chance to help.

152
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,750
Eve! Oh Jesus Christ,
you're okay.

153
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,041
I'm fine.

154
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,666
What's happening
with Mark and Omni-Man?

155
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,101
Omni-Man's kicking
the shit out of him.

156
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,750
The world's gone
fucking nuts.

157
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:10,958
Indeed.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,625
I truly hope
Mark lives up to his name.

159
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,541
To face his father and survive,

160
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,583
he'll need to be...

161
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,875
Don't do this!

162
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,375
It's not too late.

163
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,500
Yes, it is.

164
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,875
Target acquired.

165
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,291
Engaging.

166
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,041
Cecil wants to waste more time.

167
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,416
Look what they need to mimic
a fraction of our power.

168
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,767
As soon as they separate,

169
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,875
hit him
with everything you've got.

170
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:05,956
Roger that.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,583
It's right to pity them, Mark,

172
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,833
but wrong to value them
over your own kind.

173
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,833
Now! Now! Now!

174
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,541
Direct hit.

175
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,166
Repeat, direct hit on Omni-Man.

176
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,416
- I got you.
- Chute won't deploy!

177
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,458
You won't need it.

178
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,000
Huh?

179
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,166
Ah, man!

180
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,208
Thank you.

181
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,351
Didn't think
I was gonna make it.

182
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,708
You almost killed him!

183
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,541
Instead, you saved him.

184
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,791
So much effort...

185
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,375
for what?

186
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,541
No!

187
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,708
Where was that other one?

188
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:36,791
He's on my six.

189
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,416
You killed him!

190
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,416
Now or in 50 years
when he's old.

191
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,416
What difference
does it make?

192
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,833
What difference?

193
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,083
He'd have a life!

194
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,166
Did seeing that man
lose his life disturb you?

195
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,416
Did it hurt?

196
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,958
Well, let's see
how you handle this.

197
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,791
Gretchen!

198
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,166
Mommy!

199
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,916
I've got you.
I've got you.

200
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,309
Don't move! Don't move!

201
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:34,833
Don't be scared, okay?

202
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,250
No, no!

203
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,625
How could you do this?

204
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,041
That was your fault.

205
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,166
Your stubbornness
against the inevitable

206
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,208
killed those people.

207
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,416
How many more
need to die, Mark?

208
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,458
It's up to you.

209
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,708
And what were they doing

210
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,916
with those
fragile little lives anyway?

211
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,333
Listen to what I'm saying.

212
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,208
You know in your heart
I'm right.

213
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,000
Right?

214
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,625
About how pathetic
and pointless humanity is?

215
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,500
Is Mom's life worthless?

216
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,750
In the grand scheme of things...

217
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,083
Yes.

218
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,583
Debbie.

219
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,625
How can you
say those things?

220
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,166
How can you say that about Mom?

221
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,666
Liar!

222
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,083
For the first time in your life,
I'm telling you the truth.

223
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,708
Let me...

224
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,916
I need to save them.

225
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,041
No.

226
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,458
Maybe this time,
you'll learn.

227
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,000
These people
are meaningless.

228
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,291
They're cavemen without us.

229
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,250
You're wrong!

230
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,083
I've seen you save people...

231
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,958
I've seen you almost die
to protect them.

232
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,916
Maybe you were a Viltrumite
when you came to Earth,

233
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,000
but you've changed!

234
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,458
You were happy here!

235
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,208
Sure. I was happy.

236
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,458
For a time.

237
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,791
But I'm loyal to Viltrum,

238
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,208
not this pathetic excuse
for a civilization.

239
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,375
Get off me!

240
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,101
You aren't listening, Mark.

241
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:20,666
My time here has been
a speck in the span of my life.

242
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,333
You don't know me.

243
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:27,000
I will burn this planet down

244
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,833
before I spend another minute

245
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,625
living among these animals.

246
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,125
Please.

247
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,625
I was wrong
to raise you as a human.

248
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,625
I should have
prepared you better.

249
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,958
Taught you more.

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,583
Your life has been
soft and painless.

251
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,541
You're a Viltrumite
in blood only.

252
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:14,750
Well, your true education
begins now.

253
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, my god. Mark...

254
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:27,875
Gear up.

255
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,458
We can't stop this fight,
but we can save lives.

256
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,750
Cecil's orders
were to stay here.

257
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,125
We don't care.

258
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,416
You're not a robot anymore,
remember?

259
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,250
Had enough yet?

260
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,208
I'll stop you.

261
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,500
I'm ready when you are.

262
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,166
You're doing this for nothing.

263
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,916
Being a part of the empire

264
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,125
will make Earth better
than it ever was.

265
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,041
And what if they resist?

266
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,166
That's why we're here.

267
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,583
To keep them from resisting.

268
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,708
To show them how wrong they are,

269
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,375
how pointless it is...

270
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:15,041
That they can be a part
of something bigger.

271
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,083
Or die.

272
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,375
I won't let you.

273
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,583
You want to die
for this planet?

274
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,708
Fine.

275
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,291
What's 17 more years?

276
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,250
I can always start again...

277
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,291
make another kid.

278
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,208
Yeah!

279
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,833
What are you doing?

280
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,083
If I have to watch this...

281
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,208
game,

282
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,392
I'd have a better view
from above.

283
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,958
You know you can't do that.

284
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,083
It's bad enough

285
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,517
you're standing over here
like a weirdo.

286
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,875
Come sit down.

287
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,375
This is a waste
of everyone's time.

288
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,666
There's so much more
I could be doing right now.

289
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,166
Go, Mark!

290
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,875
Oh! You're gonna miss it!

291
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,375
- Look at Mark.
- Strike one!

292
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,291
You and I, we made him.

293
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,125
He's ours.

294
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,875
When he feels joy, we feel joy.

295
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,166
See that look on his face?

296
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,666
How can you see that
and not feel the same way?

297
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,625
Strike two!

298
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,166
As we get older,
it's harder to feel that.

299
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,833
The weight of the world,

300
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:40,875
it bogs us down.

301
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,041
Nice one, honey!

302
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,500
But our children
remind us of the joys in life.

303
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,708
It brings us back,

304
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,625
shows us what life is all about.

305
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,958
This is humanity.

306
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,541
Yeah, yeah!
Get going, Mark!

307
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,791
Get going!

308
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,666
- C'mon, Mark!
- Go, Mark, go!

309
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,083
Go, Mark, go!

310
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,290
- C'mon, buddy, you can do it!
- Go, Mark! Go, Mark!

311
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,666
And safe!

312
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,500
Did you see, Dad?
Did you see?

313
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,791
Aw, that was amazing!

314
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,208
Yeah.

315
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,583
Yeah, I saw.

316
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,208
Dammit!

317
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,708
Why did you make me do this?

318
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,041
You're fighting so you can watch
everyone around you die!

319
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,583
Think, Mark!

320
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,750
You'll outlast

321
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,000
every fragile, insignificant
being on this planet.

322
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:30,125
You'll live to see this world
crumble to dust and blow away!

323
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:34,625
Everyone and everything
you know will be gone!

324
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,708
What will you have
after 500 years?

325
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,750
You, Dad.

326
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,000
I'd still have you.

327
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,791
Dad?

328
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,958
This is the scene
in downtown Chicago

329
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,166
as darkness falls
on the day the world changed.

330
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,333
Omni-Man and Invincible
touched down here

331
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,041
during their terrible battle.

332
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,833
The damage you can see
behind me

333
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,083
was done in a matter of minutes

334
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,333
before they carried
their fight elsewhere.

335
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,708
I can't begin
to explain the devastation,

336
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,791
the pain...

337
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,375
the loss.

338
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:27,541
It's like nothing...

339
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,375
...nothing I've ever seen.

340
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,833
And we're all asking
the same question...

341
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,125
how could someone
who promised to keep us safe,

342
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:42,333
to protect us
against any threat,

343
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,583
become that threat?

344
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,416
Without answers,

345
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,833
all we can do
is hold each other

346
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,250
as we pick up the pieces.

347
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
City planners estimate

348
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,375
that it will take weeks
to clear the area

349
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:01,333
before rebuilding can begin.

350
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,625
The cost in lives...

351
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,291
the cost in lives
is incalculable.

352
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,583
Thankfully,

353
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,166
the Guardians of the Globe
and Atom Eve are on the scene.

354
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,333
There's been no sign
of Omni-Man or Invincible

355
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,250
since yesterday.

356
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,875
In time, we hope to know
what ended this attack,

357
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,541
but for now,

358
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,791
we can be thankful
that the danger is behind us.

359
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,208
Don't try to talk.

360
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,500
You're going to be okay.

361
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,541
You're safe now.

362
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,208
It's all over.

363
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,875
Here. Drink.

364
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,208
I'm so proud of you.

365
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:19,791
I'll let you rest.

366
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,125
Debbie?

367
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,083
Sorry.

368
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,625
It's okay.

369
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,000
Look, I was...

370
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,666
I was wanting to...

371
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:42,583
Look, if this is too much,
just say so.

372
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,583
If it were me,

373
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,666
it would ease my mind

374
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,934
to know that
things are taken care of, so...

375
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,038
Just get on with it, Cecil.

376
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:50,708
Since we want to preserve
Omni-Man's secret identity

377
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,250
to keep you and Mark safe,

378
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:54,458
Nolan Grayson officially died

379
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,781
when the house across the street
exploded from a gas leak.

380
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,708
Now, Nolan's travel books
always sold well,

381
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,166
but sales will see

382
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:04,208
a significant spike
after his death,

383
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,750
so you and Mark
will be fine for money.

384
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:07,833
And don't be alarmed

385
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:09,916
if you see yourself and Mark
on the news.

386
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,166
We sent proxies to the funeral

387
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,166
so your lives can go back
to some kind of normal

388
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,166
once Mark's healed up.

389
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,333
Normal?

390
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,291
Look, I...
I'm sorry.

391
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,666
I didn't mean...

392
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:19,875
What I meant was...

393
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:21,333
No. I'm sorry.

394
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,833
This is all very kind.

395
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:23,875
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

396
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,351
Nolan was doing
everything under my nose

397
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,583
and I never saw it.

398
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,309
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

399
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,213
if I didn't make things
as right as they can be.

400
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,000
Man.

401
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,750
We haven't earned it yet.

402
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,333
Seriously?

403
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,375
Fuck off.

404
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,333
I said, stop!

405
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,125

Hey, William.

435
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:20,208
Oh, um, hey, Eve.

436
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,125
Uh...

437
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:24,041
Have you heard from Mark?

438
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,375
Not since that stuff

439
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:26,916
between him and his dad
on the news.

440
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,166
I'm really worried tha...

441
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,208
Oh, shit!

442
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,041
Wait a minute.
You know he's Invincible?

443
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,500
Oh, man.

444
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,500
You know, too?

445
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,916
Oh, thank god!
I thought I blew it.

446
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,291
You... you think he's okay?

447
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:44,416
I don't know.

448
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,625
Hmm.

449
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:56,500
That was a hell of thing
you did there, kid.

450
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,041
I, um... I thought
it might have been a dream...

451
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,291
I wish it were.

452
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,291
You've been drifting
in and out

453
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,291
for almost two weeks,

454
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,333
but my guys
got you patched up good.

455
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,750
We'll let you out
in a day or two.

456
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:13,166
I saw my dad fly away.

457
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,500
Where'd he go?

458
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,250
Get your rest, kid.
We'll talk later.

459
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,291
Hey. Wait.

460
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:21,166
Wait!

461
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,750
Aren't you going to tell me
what happened?

462
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,291
- That depends.
- On what?

463
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,375
On if you still want
to be a hero or not.

464
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,125
I don't know.

465
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,333
Come with me.

466
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,000
I wanted to tell you

467
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,791
that your mother heard
everything that your dad said,

468
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,184
so you don't have to go
through the trouble

469
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,476
of explaining this whole ordeal.

470
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,791
What? She heard everything?
How could you do that?

471
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,375
Don't you think
she deserves to know the truth?

472
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,541
Yeah, but...

473
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,916
Your mother knew
he killed the Guardians,

474
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:55,318
but she was holding out hope
there was a good reason for it.

475
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,041
So was I.

476
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,392
Better for her to know
everything about your father.

477
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,916
Maybe you're right.

478
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,958
Wait a minute.
Where are we?

479
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,958
Oh,

480
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,250
sorry.

481
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:09,083
Lights.

482
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,375
Whoa!

483
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,541
That's enough.

484
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,708
Lights.

485
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:35,083
What? What the hell
just happened?

486
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,333
Where'd all that go?

487
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:39,125
The water America drinks
so conveniently from their taps

488
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,750
is laced with a chemical

489
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:41,958
that inhibits the ability

490
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,875
to see
certain frequencies of light.

491
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,309
Those frequencies
are used in this room.

492
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,541
So it's all just invisible?

493
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,041
You and everyone else
in America

494
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,458
do not have the ability
to see the things in this room.

495
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,583
You'd be surprised
how often we use this.

496
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:55,625
Wild.

497
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,416
To answer your question,

498
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:01,583
we monitored your father
until he left our solar system.

499
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:02,642
He didn't change trajectory,

500
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:04,458
so he's going somewhere
pretty damn far away.

501
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,375
Which means...

502
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,125
we, um...

503
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,416
we need a replacement.

504
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:13,833
No.

505
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,166
Not now. Not yet.

506
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:18,476
Your dad didn't leave me
with a lot of options, Mark.

507
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,250
If I can't call on you...

508
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,875
well, there's not really a list
past the Guardians of the Globe.

509
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,083
I know...

510
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,083
I'm sorry.

511
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,083
It's just...

512
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,083
it's too much.

513
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,750
I shouldn't have
brought this up so soon.

514
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,416
Let's get you and your mother
home first.

515
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,625
We fixed the house.

516
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,184
Talked to your school
and Debbie's work.

517
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,458
There's even a headstone
in the cemetery...

518
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,833
not that you'd want to visit it.

519
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:48,375
If either of you
need anything else,

520
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:49,750
you know how to reach me.

521
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,083
Thanks, Cecil.

522
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,166
Much better.

523
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:59,708
I'm going to go
lie down for a bit.

524
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,416
Okay, Mom.

525
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:18,750
Guess who's
finally getting his powers.

526
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,458
Oh, that's great, son,
just great!

527
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:27,208
If you really want to do
what I do,

528
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,041
you have to be prepared
for anything.

529
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:31,375
Dad!

530
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:33,375
Ow! Ribs.

531
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,458
I'm scared, Dad.

532
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,416
What if I can't do this?

533
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:40,000
This is the beginning

534
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:42,291
of a long journey
for you and me.

535
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,250
Along the way,

536
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,333
you're going to need

537
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:46,541
to do things
you don't want to do,

538
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:49,125
or might not think you can do.

539
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,541
You're a Viltrumite.

540
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,500
We have responsibilities...

541
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,958
...that normal humans don't.

542
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,559
I want to do what you do!

543
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,041
I want to be just like you.

544
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,875
You will be, son.

545
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,500
You will be.

546
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,250
Mom!

547
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:19,666
I'm going to order
something for dinner.

548
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,291
Want to get a pizza?

549
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:42,041
Mark!

550
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:46,708
Whoa. Uh...

551
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,750
Does this mean... uh?

552
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:51,166
I mean, if you want.

553
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,625
But what about...

554
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:55,125
Looks like I wasn't
the only person being lied to.

555
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,291
You know Omni-Man is my...

556
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,583
They said your dad was killed

557
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,000
when a gas line
blew up across the street.

558
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,875
Not that hard
to figure it out from there.

559
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:04,000
Detective Amber,

560
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:06,041
ready to help out
on any tough cases that come up.

561
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,791
Are you...

562
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:12,833
I know you're not okay,

563
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:14,625
but do you want
to talk about it?

564
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:15,833
Yeah.

565
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,916
I think I do.

566
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,375
Mark!

567
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,541
Oh, man, it's so good
to see you're all right.

568
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,458
I mean, after everything
on the TV

569
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,916
about you and Omniiii...

570
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,333
Uh, hey, Amber.

571
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:31,375
Uh, um...

572
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,958
She knows about my dad.

573
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,583
Oh, okay.

574
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,583
They know?

575
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:40,041
You guys want to, uh...

576
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,166
Let's go out.

577
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:52,416
We're not open!

578
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:54,333
How did you get...

579
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:55,416
Debbie.

580
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,833
How are you holding up?

581
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:04,458
Scratch that.
Stupid question.

582
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,166
What can I do for you?

583
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:09,958
I spent so much time

584
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,458
thinking about

585
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,041
if Nolan had killed
the Guardians...

586
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,625
and why he would have done it...

587
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:17,791
I...

588
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:19,833
I didn't think about
what would happen afterwards.

589
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,208
Where it would leave me...

590
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,250
and Mark.

591
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:29,500
After everything
Nolan said and did...

592
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,458
I still can't believe it.

593
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:35,375
I can't believe
our time together was a lie.

594
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:39,875
I wish he'd come back.

595
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:44,500
Me too.

596
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,333
Pour me one of those.

597
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:52,791
I've only got
the one glass.

598
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,208
I don't care. Pour.

599
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,000
How's your mom taking it?

600
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,291
About as badly
as you'd expect.

601
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,083
Mark, I am so sorry.

602
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,458
I don't know what to say.

603
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,041
It's like I'm hollow inside.

604
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,333
Nothing seems real.

605
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,125
We don't have to do this here.

606
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,166
No.

607
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,333
It's okay.

608
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,809
I just needed
to get out of the house.

609
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,250
But can we...

610
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:20,250
talk about something else?

611
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,500
We can try,

612
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:22,583
but it's literally

613
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,791
all anyone is talking about
in the whole world.

614
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,333
Okay.

615
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:28,583
Sorry.

616
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:29,583
New topic.

617
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,666
Uh... Huh.

618
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:36,416
Hold on.

619
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:37,333
Hello?

620
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:40,041
I need you. Now. Hurry.

621
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,416
Sorry, I'll be right back.

622
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,166
What is it?

623
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,875
I know you've said
you don't want to do this.

624
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:50,375
Someone's flying towards Earth
from deep space.

625
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:51,976
We're still trying
to figure out who it is,

626
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
but...

627
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,208
You know about
Mark and Omni-Man now,

628
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,916
so you might as well
know about me.

629
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:03,916
I met Mark in costume

630
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,666
before I realized
we went to the same school.

631
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,208
I'm, um...

632
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,916
well, I'm Atom Eve.

633
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:10,833
What?

634
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,791
Oh, my god, I see it now!

635
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,125
You can make
doubles of yourself!

636
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,583
No! That's Dupli-Kate.

637
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:17,625
I'm the pink one.

638
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,000
Oh, right.

639
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,375
Of course.

640
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:40,416
Invincible!

641
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:41,666
Oh...

642
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:42,916
it's just you.

643
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,083
Oh, thank heavens!
I-I thought I was too late!

644
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,083
I have to warn you!

645
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,333
Warn me?

646
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,416
When I returned
to the Coalition of Planets

647
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,750
to tell them I'd been going
to Earth instead of Urath,

648
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:52,916
they lost their minds!

649
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,458
Earth is off limits...

650
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,750
there's a Viltrumite
living on your planet!

651
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,250
Oh. That.

652
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:00,416
Wait... What?

653
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:01,625
You already know?

654
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:03,916
Uh... yeah.

655
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,750
I don't understand.

656
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:07,666
Grab a seat.
This may take a while.

657
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:12,458
So...

658
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,708
you're a Viltrumite?

659
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,250
But you don't work for them?

660
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,291
And your dad tried
to take over the planet

661
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,416
but then left?

662
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:22,458
He just left?
That's nuts, man.

663
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,833
Yeah.

664
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,833
As far as we can tell,
my dad is just gone.

665
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,833
That is super weird
for a Viltrumite.

666
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:30,708
They don't just give up.

667
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,791
They're relentless.

668
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:33,833
They destroyed my world

669
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:36,166
when my people
rebelled against them.

670
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,041
They blew up our planet
rather than lose it.

671
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,708
Jesus...

672
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,708
I'm sorry.

673
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,000
Don't be.

674
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:43,958
From the sounds of it,

675
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,958
I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

676
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,309
If I'd checked
my orders properly,

677
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,416
I would've seen

678
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,541
that Earth was flagged
for Viltrumite takeover.

679
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,958
I could have warned you.

680
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,142
I would have just
gone to my dad

681
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:54,583
and told him everything.

682
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:56,208
Who knows
what would have happened then?

683
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,000
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

684
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:00,000
Literally.

685
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,500
Like, I have no concept of it.

686
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:02,500
With my home world gone,

687
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:03,500
my people had to create
breeding camps

688
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,833
just to stop us
from going extinct.

689
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:06,892
I've never even
met my father.

690
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:09,208
After the last few days,

691
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,375
I'm jealous.

692
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:13,166
The Coalition of Planets
will want to hear about you.

693
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,416
A power struggle's brewing

694
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,958
in the farthest reaches
of space.

695
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,958
What kind of
power struggle?

696
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,333
The Coalition is trying

697
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,583
to unite enough worlds
to stop the Viltrumite empire.

698
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:23,208
The thing is...

699
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,291
no one's even heard of

700
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:27,750
a Viltrumite
abandoning their post.

701
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:28,750
It's insane.

702
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:30,166
It just doesn't happen.

703
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,750
This could be the advantage
we've been looking for.

704
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:36,916
Sure.

705
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:38,476
Let me know if I can do
anything to help.

706
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,125
I don't get
why you're smiling?

707
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:43,708
Just thinking about
everything I've been through.

708
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,750
How huge it all feels.

709
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:46,750
But the fact it's just

710
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,625
a small part of something
much larger

711
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,583
makes it all seem more...

712
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,000
manageable.

713
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,500
I don't know.
But it helps.

714
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,500
Sorry to rain on your parade.

715
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:57,701
That happens on Earth, right?

716
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,380
Anyway, once they find out
your father took off,

717
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:02,166
the Viltrumites
are gonna come for you.

718
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,458
Trust me, when they set
their sights on a planet,

719
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,750
they don't give up
without a fight.

720
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,041
I'll be ready.

721
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,583
I hope so.

722
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:10,642
What's the plan
in the meantime?

723
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,125
♪ Do what I want
'cause I can ♪

724
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,291
