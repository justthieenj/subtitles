1
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,708
Guys! Help me!

2
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:22,666
Mark?

3
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,583
You can't tell anyone?

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,833
Where the hell did you go?

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,833
This isn't what it looks like.

6
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,250
Wait! Amber!

7
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,041
Your recovery
was tenuous at times.

8
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,291
You stayed with me?

9
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,458
I never left.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,000
You know how hard it is
to grow cells this quickly?

11
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,791
You will receive the schematics
when you finish your work.

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,375
We need some insurance.

13
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,875
This is the oldest blood
on the suit.

14
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,750
Nolan struck first.

15
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:50,791
Why did you do it?

16
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:51,750
I didn't do anything.

17
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,833
Fuck you, Nolan.

Why did you keep it?

47
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,125
I used it to take care
of Damien Darkblood,

48
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,875
but maybe part of me
wanted you to find it, too.

49
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,458
After 20 years together,

50
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,708
I deserve to know the truth.

51
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,458
I wanted to tell you
months ago.

52
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,791
But you didn't.

53
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,208
Was someone controlling you?

54
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,375
Were you...
were you blackmailed?

55
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,541
Did they threaten me
or Mark?

56
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,041
No.

57
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,625
Then why?

58
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,541
You need to trust me.

59
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,125
If you can do that,

60
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,583
we'll be okay.

61
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,541
Mark too.

62
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,875
Everything will be fine.

63
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:29,875
Trust you?

64
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,875
How could I possibly
trust you now?

65
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,375
Because you know me.

66
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,041
There's a lot of things
I thought I knew about you.

67
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,916
The Guardians
were our friends.

68
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,125
They were good people.

69
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,291
They saved lives.

70
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,583
They had families.

71
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,416
You killed them.

72
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,458
I had no choice.

73
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,583
I don't believe that.

74
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,625
You said you wanted
to tell me months ago,

75
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,583
but you're still
not telling me now.

76
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,250
No, I don't trust you.

77
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,291
Not anymore.

78
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,416
You broke that.

79
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,125
If you don't have
anything else to say,

80
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,125
you need to leave.

81
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,166
Debbie...

82
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,166
Get out of my house.

83
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,208
You don't mean that.

84
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,666
Get out of my house!

85
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,791
We'll talk later.

86
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,416
Hey...

87
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,083
Mark? It's Mom.
Listen to me...

88
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm not around.

89
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,083
You could leave a message,

90
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,517
but wouldn't you rather
text me instead?

91
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,708
Mark, it's Mom.

92
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,041
Come home. Please...

93
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,416
Debbie, I'm sorry,
but you have to come with us.

94
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,875
There's no time.

95
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,416
Thanks, William.

96
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,208
See you later.

97
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,041
Bye, Amber.

98
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:48,875
See you later.

99
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,708
Amber!

100
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,916
Uh...

101
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,458
Come on, this is dumb.

102
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,625
No, what's dumb

103
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,250
is how long I've been putting up
with your bullshit.

104
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,291
You're right.

105
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,458
I've been an asshole,

106
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,000
and I'm sorry
I didn't realize that sooner,

107
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,541
but that all stops today.

108
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,041
Amber...

109
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,666
Uh...

110
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,083
Oh, here we go...

111
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,208
Amber, I'm in...

112
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,083
Oh, my god!

113
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,166
It's okay.

114
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,375
This is why I'm always late,
or why I don't show,

115
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,041
because I'm off saving lives,

116
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,625
or stopping some bad guys, or...

117
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,291
going to Mars.

118
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,541
I wanted to tell you
so many times.

119
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,541
Uh...

120
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,208
did you hear what I just said?

121
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,916
I know you're a superhero.

122
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,000
You know...

123
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:46,916
Y-you know?

124
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:47,958
I'm not an idiot.

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,500
I figured it out weeks ago.

126
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,125
Then why are we fighting?

127
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,250
We're fighting
because you lied to me.

128
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,041
You made me feel stupid
and unimportant...

129
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,375
It's a secret identity!

130
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,791
...and because
you don't trust me.

131
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,791
I'm trusting you now!

132
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,750
Oh, my god.

133
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,708
I mean, it's cute
you think that's enough.

134
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,958
But Amber...

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,250
Fly away, flyboy,

136
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,458
or take the stairs.

137
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,041
I really don't give a shit.

138
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,791
I'd like to be alone.

139
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,541
Hello?

140
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,500
Hmm, so much for "welcome back."

141
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,791
Congrats for not dying

142
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,833
when a giant space cat
gave you brain surgery.

143
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,083
- There she is!
- It's so good to see you!

144
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,541
Haha, there's our girl!

145
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,666
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, Monster Girl!

146
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:37,625
Welcome back!

147
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,791
She returns victorious!

148
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,875
Well, well, well,

149
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:42,916
it's about time

150
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,041
you dragged
your lazy ass back here.

151
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,208
I was getting pretty tired

152
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,791
of hanging out with these dorks
all by myself.

153
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,791
We start partying now.

154
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,375
It's 10:00 a.m.

155
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,833
We're the Guardians
of the Globe, baby.

156
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,375
If we can die at any time,

157
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,708
uh, we can drink
at any time.

158
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,041
I put your picture on the side!

159
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:01,875
Ha. Ha.

160
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,708
Cute.

161
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,458
But I'm lactose intolerant.

162
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,458
Whoa, hold on.

163
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,916
Do you know me at all?

164
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,458
I filled them with beer.

165
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,125
You're welcome.

166
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,642
Guess how long
it took him to do that?

167
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,500
And how much milk
he wasted.

168
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,708
I poured it all down the drain.

169
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,041
Why are you never
this industrious

170
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,208
when it involves training?

171
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,958
How come I get
my head beat in,

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,142
and it's a week
in the hospital.

173
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,208
You get your head beat in,

174
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,458
and your powers come back?

175
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,791
I figure it's karma
for putting up with this guy.

176
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,625
You're welcome.

177
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,541
I am delighted at
your recovery, Monster Girl.

178
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,208
Very much.

179
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,708
I wouldn't be recovered
if it wasn't for you.

180
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,250
You saved my life.

181
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,125
Of course.

182
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,916
I would never let you die.

183
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,708
Die. Die. Die.

184
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,642
Die. Die. Die. Die. Die.

185
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,458
Die. Die. Die. Die...

186
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,875
My apologies.

187
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,125
A small programming error.

188
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,041
Soon to be fixed permanently.

189
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,458
Holy shit!

190
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,666
Well, that was creepy.

191
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,750
That was like

192
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,392
the creepiest thing
I've seen you do since...

193
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,684
Do you remember
that time

194
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,250
I caught you operating
on your own head?

195
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,208
I swear to god,

196
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,708
he had his head
on the bench,

197
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,208
and he was just
standing over it,

198
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,708
prying it open with
a Phillips head screwdriver.

199
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,208
Oh, my god.
Can I get another...

200
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,208
You!

201
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,625
Get out of the truck.

202
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,291
I said, get out of the...

203
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,916
Huh?

204
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,125
Step back,

205
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,625
please.

206
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,708
Gentlemen.

207
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,208
- What is that?
- Ugh.

208
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,291
Come, now,

209
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,875
I believe you can answer
that question on your own.

210
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,208
It's the real Robot.

211
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,416
Well done.

212
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,818
Perhaps you're the original, then?

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,541
We've been growing you
a new body.

214
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,666
And now introductions
are complete,

215
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,708
show me your work.

216
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,583
It's perfect.

217
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,833
We are professionals.

218
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:47,833
Except for

219
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,083
the timed-release
mycotoxin sacs,

220
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,916
the embedded cortical override,

221
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,000
and the seven...

222
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,583
oh, sorry, eight,
synaptic transceivers.

223
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,125
Maybe I'm old-fashioned,

224
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,226
but I prefer to be
the only person

225
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,500
in control of my body.

226
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,375
Please.

227
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,267
I would have been disappointed
if you hadn't tried.

228
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,625
Remove all of that,

229
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,041
add in this small upgrade
of my own design,

230
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,000
and we can discuss your payment.

231
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,416
Let's discuss our payment
and we'll do all of that.

232
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,083
A Global Defense Agency
control collar

233
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,625
placates the strongest of wills.

234
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,750
A highly-restricted technology.

235
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,000
It's encrypted.

236
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,250
Besides, a little trust
goes a long way.

237
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,166
Actions go further.

238
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,250
There.

239
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,583
I am alone and helpless.

240
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,000
Sheesh.

241
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,375
Alone, yes.

242
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,333
Helpless, I doubt it.

243
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,083
Do what he wants.

244
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,541
It needs to be placed on the...

245
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,958
Upper brainstem.

246
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,125
I recognize a neural-link
when I see one.

247
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,250
Yesterday was messed up.

248
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,583
I mean, is Rick
ever gonna be okay?

249
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,750
God...

250
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,125
What that Sinclair guy
was doing to people...

251
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,125
Cecil's team
knows what they're doing.

252
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,416
They'll help Rick.

253
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,750
I gotta say it...

254
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,375
If you had helped me find him
right away,

255
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,125
none of this
would have ever happened.

256
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,125
I know.

257
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,541
I'm sorry.

258
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,625
I suck.

259
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,250
It figures,

260
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,541
I finally fall for someone,

261
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,958
and then... boom.

262
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,708
Cyborg.

263
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,583
So this is why
I've hardly seen you

264
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,000
the last six months.

265
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,750
Because you're a superhero.

266
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,583
Not anymore.

267
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,791
What? Why?

268
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,958
Because I'm a terrible friend
and a worse boyfriend.

269
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,500
Because I'm gonna fail
my last year of high school.

270
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,000
Because I got everything
I ever wanted,

271
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,500
and I messed it all up.

272
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,958
I should've listened to my dad.

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,291
Your dad?

274
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,625
Omni-Man.

275
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,833
Oh.

276
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,041
Of course.

277
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,041
Your dad's Omni-Man.

278
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,416
How did I never see that?

279
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,791
I am such a screw-up.

280
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,750
Okay, stop.

281
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,916
Enough with the sulking,
you big baby.

282
00:11:58,958 --> 00:11:59,833
What?

283
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,166
You can fly.

284
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,416
You're invulnerable.

285
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,000
Your dad's the greatest
superhero on Earth,

286
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,666
and your mom loves
and cares about you.

287
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,333
You just need to study,
and you can pull up your grades.

288
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,125
But you were
a terrible boyfriend to Amber,

289
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,351
and you got what you deserved.

290
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,666
Sorry, not sorry.

291
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,333
If I can deal with almost losing
the hottest guy I've ever had,

292
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,750
you can deal with this.

293
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:20,750
What?

294
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,809
Friends tell friends the truth.

295
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,750
Not like that, they don't!

296
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,291
I just got dumped, dude!

297
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,333
You got dumped weeks ago,
you just didn't realize it.

298
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,809
You're like a bad guy
in a samurai movie

299
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,833
who gets cut in half,

300
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,791
but thinks they're fine

301
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,625
until they're like, "Oh, my god,

302
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,125
my top half's sliding away
from my bottom half."

303
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,416
I love you, man,

304
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,250
but I need someone else
to talk to.

305
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,416
Debbie?

306
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,601
Good.
We need to talk about...

307
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,583
Nolan killed
the Guardians of the Globe.

308
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,708
I know.

309
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,500
How could you know
and not tell me?

310
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,041
I couldn't risk Nolan
finding out we knew.

311
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,041
Not until we figured out

312
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,875
what he was doing
and how to stop him.

313
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,458
We failed on both those counts,
by the way.

314
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,333
What do you mean, stop him?

315
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,750
Do you mean kill him?

316
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,041
Cecil...

317
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,601
I'm not sure
we could kill him.

318
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,500
Not us, anyway.

319
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,000
There's only one person I know

320
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,041
who might be able to go
toe-to-toe with Omni-Man

321
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,833
and come out on top, Debbie.

322
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,166
No.

323
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,875
No. Never.

324
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:31,750
You can't.

325
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,750
Where's Mark, Debbie?

326
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,791
Where's...

327
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,833
Mark...

328
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,708
I killed
the Guardians of the Globe.

329
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,250
Wait, before you say anything,
just listen.

330
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,333
Please.

331
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,666
I'm not a monster.

332
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,708
I didn't want to do it...

333
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,083
but it had to be done.

334
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,291
It was my responsibility.

335
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,708
Other people
won't understand that,

336
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,000
but I know you can.

337
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:08,041
What I'm about to tell you
will change everything.

338
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,208
Just remember, you're my son,

339
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,125
and I love you and your mother
more than...

340
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,458
What am I doing?

341
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,750
Ugh. Disgusting.

342
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,125
I didn't design it
to be drained,

343
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,333
or ever opened.

344
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,833
What changed?

345
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,375
I met someone.

346
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,416
Make room, please.

347
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,291
Hurry, please.

348
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,041
Air is toxic to me.

349
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,000
It burns my... my lungs.

350
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,625
Yuck...

351
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,083
Don't make a face.

352
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,166
You lost the coin toss.

353
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,833
This will be painful.

354
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:24,333
My entire life
has been painful.

355
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,500
You realize

356
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,958
this procedure doesn't
transfer you to the new body.

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,916
It creates a copy of your mind.

358
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,833
For you, nothing will change.

359
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,458
For him, everything will.

360
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,375
I... understand.

361
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,708
Three, two...

362
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,333
Of course, his brain's abnormal.

363
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,875
You didn't think of that?

364
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:20,750
Look at him!

365
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,000
Shut up, will you?

366
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,333
His motor cortex
is the size of a pea.

367
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,000
Same for his occipital
and parietal lobes.

368
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,750
They've all been eaten alive
by his oversized cerebrum.

369
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,125
The system wasn't designed
for neurons this dense.

370
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,500
Are you calling us stupid?

371
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,583
Yes.

372
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,916
I'm calling us stupid.

373
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,208
Compensating now,

374
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,791
but it's gonna be close.

375
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,208
Idiot!

376
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,458
You just lost us
our control collars.

377
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,125
Just get the fire extinguisher
before we lose everything else.

378
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,083
Which...

379
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,958
Which am I?

380
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,208
See?

381
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,958
It's not just us.

382
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,666
You won the coin toss, champ.

383
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,083
You're the new one.

384
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,958
I...

385
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
wasn't expecting this.

386
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,833
This feeling of continuance.

387
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,250
I closed my eyes...

388
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,208
and opened new ones.

389
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,000
I didn't know which one I'd be.

390
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,666
That's how it works.

391
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,458
We had to make it seamless,

392
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,000
otherwise one of us knows
he's the clone,

393
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,166
and that never ends well.

394
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:42,500
In your case,
it's a little more obvious,

395
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,750
but it looks like that problem
took care of itself.

396
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, shit, here we go.

397
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,250
I'm sorry it wasn't you.

398
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,541
D-Don't be.

399
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,125
Be... happy.

400
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,958
Change the...

401
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,583
...world.

402
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,333
Experience everything...

403
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,250
we never could.

404
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,083
What are you...

405
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,458
w-waiting for?

406
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,666
This was always the plan.

407
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,166
I can put you back in the pod.

408
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,833
We can both survive.

409
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,750
Change the world together.

410
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,500
This is...

411
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,750
what I want.

412
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,166
Please.

413
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,708
It was an act of mercy.

414
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,000
We know.

415
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,333
We do it all the time.

416
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,291
Now...

417
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,708
our schematics.

418
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,875
The cryptographic key

419
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,458
is the entire text
of Frankenstein.

420
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,791
Look who has
a sense of humor after all.

421
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,208
And now that our deal
is complete,

422
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,041
it's time you both
returned to prison.

423
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,791
He's serious.

424
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,791
Yeah, he's also a teenage boy.

425
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:41,541
No, I'm a 30-year old genius
in a teenage boy's body,

426
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,708
with a neural-link chip
you just installed for me.

427
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,041
That was your plan?

428
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,375
My plan was not to hurt you,

429
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,833
but here we are.

430
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,250
Mark?

431
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,166
Mark?

432
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,291
Debbie?

433
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,375
What did you do?

434
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,708
Cecil...

435
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,416
Oh, shit.

436
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,500
Nolan, wait.

437
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:39,916
Just wait...

438
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,791
You've been spying on me?

439
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:42,833
On my family?

440
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,000
It-it was
for your family's protection.

441
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,416
You were always
so pathetic, Donald.

442
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,083
Cecil's little lapdog.

443
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,250
Run now!

444
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,125
Oh, shit.

445
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,375
It's been an honor, sir.

446
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,125
Huh.
Who are you talking to...

447
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,666
The honor was all mine.

448
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:22,791
Oh, no...

449
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:23,791
Oh, god.

450
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,500
Nolan?

451
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,041
You monster.

452
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,375
He's not dead.

453
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,000
Even after evacuating
the neighborhood,

454
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,000
we had to keep
the yield down.

455
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,166
Best it'll do

456
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,851
is knock him on his ass
for an hour or two...

457
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,083
or maybe not even
hurt him at all.

458
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,958
He's going to find Mark.

459
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,958
I don't know
who Nolan is anymore.

460
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,916
I don't know
what he's going to do.

461
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:49,916
Me neither.

462
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,916
So we'd better
find Mark first.

463
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:01,500
Huh?

464
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,291
Hey, Eve.

465
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,166
Oh...

466
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,375

is pure theater.

00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,541

And you're both clones as well.

479
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,500
Exactly,

480
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,341

to being a clone...

00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:40,458

Very clever,

489
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,625
but you don't have
nearly enough equipment

490
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:15,000
to do that again.

491
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,791
All Guardians to HQ.

492
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,375
Apocalypse level priority.

493
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:25,083
He's right.

494
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,458
What do you want to do?

495
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,333
I want to break his stupid face,

496
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,958
even though we just
finished making it.

497
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,083
I'll keep his machine busy.

498
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,250
On three.

499
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,666
One, two, three!

500
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:40,625
Huh?

501
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,666
What the hell was that?

502
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:57,851
O-Omni...

503
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:00,083
Uh, Mr. Grayson...

504
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,500
Are you okay?

505
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,000
You look kinda, uh...

506
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,250
recently on fire.

507
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,875
Where's Mark, William?

508
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:14,583
You were supposed
to drop him off an hour ago.

509
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,208
Uh, Amber dumped him,

510
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,791
and he didn't like my advice,

511
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,000
so he went to go find Eve.

512
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,333
Call him.

513
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,500
His phone's broken.

514
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,333
There was this attack
at the college, and...

515
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,559
and all of a sudden, we were...

516
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:30,375
Where's Eve?

517
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:31,416
Uh...

518
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,625
Mark said she got a place
out in the woods,

519
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,500
a couple hundred miles
west of here.

520
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,333
That's not...

521
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,333
blood on you, is it?

522
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,208
Bye?

523
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,375
Look, be quiet!

524
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:51,916
Just sit tight
until I call on you,

525
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,142
and hope to hell
I don't have to.

526
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,333
Sit tight?

527
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,208
Hey, we're not your kids
in the back seat

528
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,767
while you run in
to buy cigarettes, Cecil.

529
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:58,750
What the hell's going on?

530
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,250
I said, sit tight.

531
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:01,708
Oh, come on.

532
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,833
I mean, come on!

533
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:04,916
For once, you're right.

534
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,375
We need to know
what's happening.

535
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,000
Robot, can't you do
a little hacking

536
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,541
and find out
what's going down?

537
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,291
Oh great.

538
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,500
The hits just keep on comin'.

539
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:17,041
Look who crashed again.

540
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:18,000
Okay.

541
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,416
You know, we'll all be lucky

542
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,833
if murderbot here

543
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,958
doesn't strangle us all
in our sleep.

544
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,291
Hello! Robot!

545
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,166
Hello, anybody home?

546
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,541
You know what he needs?

547
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,375
He needs one of those
spinning ball things

548
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,833
so we know he's still alive.

549
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:35,250
I'm very much alive,
more so now than ever.

550
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,625
What the fuck?

551
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:39,166
Who the hell are you?

552
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,666
You all know me as Robot,

553
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:43,125
but my real name
is Rudolph Connors,

554
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:45,500
though I'd prefer
if you called me Rudy.

555
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:46,916
The Robot you knew before

556
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,083
was simply a drone
I controlled remotely.

557
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,125
What?

558
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,166
How do we know
you're telling the truth?

559
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:55,250
Ask me something
only Robot would know.

560
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,875
Why the fuck
do you look like me?

561
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:58,791
How the fuck
do you look like me?

562
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:01,791
That is a much longer story.

563
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,333
One that can wait

564
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,958
until whatever crisis this is
has been resolved...

565
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,875
No, no, no,
forget the crisis.

566
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,583
You can explain now.

567
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,750
I've got 'em!

568
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,458
Invincible and Atom Eve.

569
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,916
Approximately 300 miles away,

570
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,892
traveling north-west
over Rideout National Forest.

571
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:17,875
Sir,

572
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:19,434
Omni-Man's closing in
on their location.

573
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,666
Estimated time to intercept...
six minutes.

574
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,041
Shit.

575
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,041
Can't you use your teleporter?

576
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,333
To bring Mark and Eve
back here?

577
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:27,833
You need to be wearing
one of these,

578
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,000
and it can't do us
all at once.

579
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,041
We need to buy some time first.

580
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,250
Let's bring the hammer down.

581
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,708
That sucks.

582
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,416
I'm sorry you got dumped.

583
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,916
I thought
once I told her the truth,

584
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,416
we'd be good.

585
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,958
Stupid.

586
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,958
A little naive, maybe.

587
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,059
Hey, you're the one
who told me

588
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,351
not to tell Amber
I was Invincible.

589
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,125
Yeah, but I didn't tell you

590
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,791
to string her along
for five months

591
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,541
while being an asshole about it.

592
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,267
I thought you'd figure
that part out yourself.

593
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,875
Oh, my god.

594
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,416
I haven't figured out anything.

595
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,958
I don't know who I am,
who I'm supposed to be...

596
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,250
Yeah, took me a while, too.

597
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:07,333
I was with Teen Team
for three years,

598
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:10,541
and with Rex
for much longer than that.

599
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,083
And now you're... this.

600
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,958
Uh, I'm still Atom Eve,

601
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,166
and I've saved more lives
in the last three days

602
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,041
than I did
in the last three years.

603
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,666
Sorry.

604
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:20,833
I didn't mean it like that.

605
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,083
Um, and trust me,

606
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:25,500
being out here is an upgrade
to living with my parents.

607
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:29,250
I should call my mom, though.

608
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,000
You wouldn't dare.

609
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,791
Okay, we've got him.

610
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,083
He's down.

611
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,500
Hit him again.

612
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,583
400 billion dollars

613
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:56,166
for the world's
most expensive nosebleed.

614
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:01,916
Omni-Man is back on course

615
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,583
to intercept Invincible
and Atom Eve.

616
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:06,000
Power up the teleporter.

617
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:07,583
You said we couldn't
teleport them yet.

618
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,208
It's not for them.

619
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,458
Then I received Cecil's alert,

620
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,750
and left for here
as quickly as I could.

621
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,583
Any questions?

622
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,958
Uh, yeah, a few!

623
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,583
First, why me?

624
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,791
I mean, sure,

625
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:26,250
I get that anyone
would want to be me,

626
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:28,333
but why specifically me?

627
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,583
And second,

628
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,791
why a kid version of me?

629
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:32,916
That's just weird.

630
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,666
Exactly.
It's messed up.

631
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,166
You didn't even ask first.

632
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,750
That's what you think
is wrong with this?

633
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,416
There is so much
wrong with this.

634
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,083
He did it for me.

635
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,125
What?

636
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,833
What are you even
talking about?

637
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,041
We were both prisoners
in our own bodies.

638
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,541
Monster Girl slowly
getting younger,

639
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,500
and me trapped
in a mechanical tomb

640
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,666
of my own creation.

641
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:54,416
I escaped my prison.

642
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:55,833
Now I'll help you
escape yours.

643
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:56,666
No!

644
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,166
Don't give him any sympathy!

645
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,250
He still hasn't told me
why he stole my kid face!

646
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,875
You're ruining my childhood,

647
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:06,083
and that's hard
because it already sucked.

648
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,250
I adapted your DNA

649
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,875
because I noticed
Monster Girl found you...

650
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:12,000
interesting.

651
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,208
What?

652
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,791
Wait, what?

653
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:15,916
Oh, my God...

654
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,833
I don't even know
how to feel about that!

655
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,416
Goddamit, Robot!

656
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,333
Will you please
stop fucking me up?

657
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,601
So, you lied to us

658
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,642
about who you really were,

659
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,041
freed the Maulers from prison,

660
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,500
stole Rex's DNA,

661
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:28,958
conspired with criminals
to grow yourself a new body,

662
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,666
and you expect us all to be
like, "Oh sure, who wouldn't?"

663
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,041
I... Yes.

664
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:35,166
I mean, I... did.

665
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,916
I need time to process this.

666
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,017
I bet everyone else does, too.

667
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,125
Ya think?

668
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,333
Hey!

669
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,000
I know why Cecil's
holding us at high alert.

670
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,791
What the fuck is going on today?

671
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:04,166
What is that?

672
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,125
Huh, I'll tell you
what that is,

673
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,583
not our problem anymore.

674
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:10,726
We should check in with Cecil.

675
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,625
Forget it.

676
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:12,916
I'm done with all that.

677
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:13,916
So are you.

678
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,666
That's not why I came out here.

679
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,333
You came out here
to get away from Rex

680
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,583
and all that superhero bullshit.

681
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,916
Rex had nothing
to do with this.

682
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,083
I came out here because
I needed to start over,

683
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,000
but that doesn't mean
ignoring the world

684
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,500
when it needs me.

685
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,333
The world was fine
before I came along.

686
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,125
It'll be fine
without my help.

687
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,333
Better, probably.

688
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,541
I get that
you're feeling shitty

689
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:36,791
because Amber dumped you,

690
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:37,916
but trust me,

691
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,166
you'll feel worse

692
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:42,666
if you sit here and do nothing
when you could save lives.

693
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:45,833
I doubt it.

694
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:46,750
Fine,

695
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,916
but I'm going.

696
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,375
You thought that could hurt me?

697
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,041
No.

698
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,541
That was just
to get your attention.

699
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,041
Jesus, Nolan,
right for the throat?

700
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,041
After everything
that we've been through?

701
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,791
Keep out of this, Cecil.

702
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,125
You know I can't do that, Nolan.

703
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,875
I've faced death more times
than I can count,

704
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:34,041
but I'll be damned

705
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,208
if that didn't put my balls
in my throat.

706
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,541
I just wanna know why.

707
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:40,500
Every one of the Guardians

708
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:41,833
risked their necks for you,

709
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,875
over and over again.

710
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,875
I never needed their help.

711
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,125
They were weak.

712
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,250
They were your friends,

713
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:50,875
and so was I...

714
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,000
which is why I know

715
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,958
you didn't kill them
for the fun of it.

716
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,625
You had a reason.

717
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,291
You wanna get it off your chest?

718
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,083
Fine, don't tell me,

719
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,041
but what about Debbie, huh?

720
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,333
Doesn't she deserve an answer?

721
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,083
Don't say her name.

722
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,083
Why not?

723
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:17,166
You hurt her, not me.

724
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,000
She and I have that
in common now.

725
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:22,041
I'm a good liar.

726
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm a very good liar,

727
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,541
but you, you're better.

728
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,583
You fooled her.

729
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:32,000
Hell, you fooled all of us
for what, 20 years?

730
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:33,750
Wait,

731
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:36,958
does Mark know
that his dad's a murderer?

732
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,750
Does he know?

733
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,500
No?

734
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:43,184
Well, what's he gonna do
when he finds out, huh?

735
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,791
This is pointless.

736
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,166
You can't stop me.

737
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,250
Yeah, you're right.
I can't,

738
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:50,000
but I can do the same thing
I've been doing

739
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,500
since I figured out you were
a lying piece of shit.

740
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,250
I can buy us a little more time.

741
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,750
Ha!

742
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,458
What are those things?

743
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,958
Dead soldiers.

744
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,666
Serving their country
one last time

745
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,291
thanks to that monster
over there.

746
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,083
Shut it!

747
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,625
I feel dirty
even talking to you.

748
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,767
Bring 'em over here,
bring 'em over here right now.

749
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:15,083
Teleport me to Invincible
and Eve's location.

750
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,166
Once they get these strapped on,
you bring us home.

751
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:18,208
Sir,

752
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,684
Eve and Invincible
are back on the move.

753
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,166
Intercept in four minutes.

754
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,750
Shit.

755
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:31,958
Shit!

756
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:49,166
Get him out of here...

757
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:52,601
...and get Hail Mary
out of the icebox...

758
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,833
...and feed her this!

759
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,583
What a dick.

760
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,166
You want revenge?

761
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,684
Quit complaining
and finish the build.

762
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:02,750
I'm almost done here.

763
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,083
It's charged.

764
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,833
I built it exactly
to the schematics.

765
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:12,666
Good.

766
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,833
How do we know he'll revive?

767
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,750
Cecil couldn't bring him back.

768
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,083
Cecil's an idiot.

769
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,500
He's not called The Immortal
for nothing.

770
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:24,333
I'll get the collar.

771
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:47,958
You must be desperate.

772
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,041
I beat this thing already.

773
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,583
Sure...

774
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,291
but we removed its pain center,

775
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,017
and juiced it up
with every drug, enhancement,

776
00:38:58,041 --> 00:38:59,250
and upgrade we had.

777
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:03,375
Plus, all that
really pissed it off,

778
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:05,416
and it blames you.

779
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:06,583
Good luck.

780
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,625
There are two news helicopters
moving in on Omni-Man's fight.

781
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:23,291
Omni-Man
appears to be fighting

782
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,583
the same creature he battled
in the sea of Japan

783
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:27,625
over half a year ago.

784
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,666
We need to go help.

785
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,083
Keep your asses parked

786
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,000
until I tell you
to unpark them.

787
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,375
If this all goes south,

788
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:36,375
you're our last hope
against Omni-Man.

789
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,375
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

790
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,458
Did he just say

791
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,208
we're his last hope
"against" Omni-Man?

792
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,583
Yeah, he did.

793
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:43,583
Oh, fuck.

794
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:45,708
I'm pretty sure
that's what happened

795
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,166
to the last
"last hope against Omni-Man."

796
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,125
That should buy us
five minutes or so.

797
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,833
Teleport me
to Invincible's location.

798
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:09,000
Can't, sir.

799
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,125
Hail Mary was so big,
she burnt out the teleporter.

800
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:12,875
Well, goddammit, get it working,

801
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:13,791
or we're all dead.

802
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:16,375
Where do you think
he's coming next?

803
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,000
Mark's with Eve again.

804
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:26,041
Call her phone.

805
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:32,750
Took you long enough.

806
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:33,875
I'm not here to help.

807
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:35,875
Just here to make sure
you don't get hurt.

808
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,500
Well, then
you shouldn't have come.

809
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,833
Jesus, Mark,
you sound just like my...

810
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,000
Dad!

811
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,750
Eve!

812
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:51,958
It's Mark's mom.

813
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I need to talk to him!

814
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,333
You just missed him.

815
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,000
What's going on?

816
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,125
Dad!

817
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,041
You okay?

818
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:00,916
Mark?

819
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,666
You mean Invincible.

820
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,000
It's about time
we did a team-up.

821
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:13,000
Blech!

822
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:14,208
Come on!

823
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,291
But I need to help them!

824
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,625
Do not do that.

825
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,583
Get to Guardians HQ.

826
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:25,333
What? Cecil!

827
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:27,375
Listen to me and do what I say.

828
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:40,000
Call that thing off, Cecil.

829
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:41,916
Call it off!

830
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,333
Mark's in there.

831
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,083
I can't do that, Debbie.

832
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:46,916
Why not?

833
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,375
Because I can't.

834
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:50,833
Nolan killed the Guardians,
he killed Donald.

835
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,041
He's shrugged off
everything I've thrown at him,

836
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,434
and now I don't know
if Mark is with his father,

837
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,083
or against him.

838
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:57,583
So I can't call off

839
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:59,750
the one thing
that might stop them both.

840
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:03,000
This is why
I have always hated you.

841
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:06,333
That's why I hate me, too.

842
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,916
What now?

843
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:17,791
I don't know.

844
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,166
He should just be alive.

845
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:20,583
He's not.

846
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,083
You're so observant.

847
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,125
What are you doing?

848
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:27,958
Even Frankenstein
needed an extra kick

849
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,166
to come to life.

850
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:31,375
One, he's not Frankenstein.

851
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,166
Two, it was lightning,

852
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,125
and not whatever you're doing,

853
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:38,000
and three, that was only
in the movie version.

854
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:38,833
I know,

855
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:41,041
but this also feels good.

856
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,291
Wake up, you useless
murdered idiot!

857
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,500
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

858
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,041
Activate the collar.

859
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:08,958
Where is he?

860
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:12,250
Immortal,

861
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:14,208
you're going to destroy Robot

862
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,541
and the new Guardians
of the Globe for us.

863
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,041
- Uh-oh.
- Where's Omni-man?

864
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:26,583
Where is he?

865
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:34,583
Robot gave us bad schematics.

866
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,916
No kidding.

867
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:44,666
H'a!

868
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:50,208
Didn't you fight
this thing before?

869
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,833
Yeah, but it's tougher now.

870
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,416
Cecil sent it after me.

871
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,416
Cecil?

872
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:55,916
Why would he do that?

873
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,833
There's so much
you don't know, Mark.

874
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:58,666
What?

875
00:43:58,708 --> 00:43:59,750
Uh, okay.

876
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,583
Uh, maybe you can fill me in

877
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,666
after we've taken care
of tentacles here?

878
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,583
Mark?

879
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:12,500
Sir!

880
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:13,500
What?

881
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:14,500
There's a new contact

882
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:16,291
approaching Omni-Man
and Invincible.

883
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:17,333
Mach three.

884
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,750
Goddammit,
I told Eve to stay away.

885
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,166
It's not Atom Eve.

886
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:24,458
Omni-Man!

887
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,958
You bastard!

888
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,642
I'm having a hard time

889
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:46,976
believing what I'm seeing
here, folks,

890
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,541
but the Immortal,

891
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:49,809
or someone
who appears to be him,

892
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:52,375
has suddenly attacked Omni-Man.

893
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:53,500
As you all know,

894
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,958
the Immortal was murdered
eight months ago,

895
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,333
along with the other members

896
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,208
of the original
Guardians of the Globe.

897
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,958
The killer was never caught.

898
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,958
Murderer!

899
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,208
We trusted you!

900
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:07,791
You betrayed us!

901
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,958
You should've stayed dead.

902
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:16,583
Dad?

903
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,666
I'll kill you!

904
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:13,041
H'a!

905
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,666
H'a!

906
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:01,625
Dad?

907
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:09,625
Mark...

908
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:15,708
We need to talk.
